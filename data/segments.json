Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame.

And then let's try to apply the values to it to think about if you were living up to these values, what choice would you make and maybe some of the pressures you might feel to choose otherwise.\n\nLenny: So an ongoing decision I have is I have all these opportunities of things I can be doing. Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, \"Why would I do anything more? This is good.\" So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?\n\nLenny: I'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out.

I even told my manager this when I first came in, \"I'm here to learn to be a better founder.\" So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it.

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Yeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, \"I'm here to learn to be a better founder.\" So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel.

And the rule was, I had to hand out all 10 of those business cards by introducing myself to people that were new, and touch the back wall of the venue of that event and then I could leave.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I did that a couple of weeks in a row, and it was horrible. It was really awful, but it got a lot better. What I realized about that was actually two things. One that, as I started going and I saw familiar faces, it became a lot easier for me to just break in and meet people, just by seeing who people I knew already were talking to. And then second, I got a lot better at just breaking in and introducing myself and understanding how this intro and networking thing worked in terms of meeting people and moving through a crowd. Some of those relationships now from that first job and those first couple months are pretty much foundational to the network and the people that I know today. So it really paid off for me because I really focused on eating my vegetables and powering through that initial discomfort.",

It's a great book, if you're a founder or product person. But it really is a breakdown of what are the different strategies to get people to say yes and help persuade them toward things. I think it really helps in terms of thinking through that and designing a product or a business around it.\n\nLenny: I've got that in my bookshelf behind me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Oh, yeah. It's a great book. Yeah. The next book that I also recommend is a book called Designing Your Life, and it's out of the Stanford Design School. And it's by, let me look, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans.

Then he went on to lead product and growth at Patreon, where he spent over four years building one of the most successful and lasting created platforms out there. And most recently, he was CPO at Imperfect Foods. Today he spends his time advising companies on product and growth, and he's also doing a lot more writing.\n\nLenny: And in this episode we cover three things, his growth competency model, which helps you hire and evaluate growth talent and also get a job as a growth person. We go deep into why onboarding is such an underappreciated growth lever and all of the impact that you can have optimizing your onboarding flow. Adam also shares a super cool framework for choosing which company to work at. Adam is hilarious and he's so full of wisdom and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Adam Fishman.\n\nLenny: This episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing, it's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.",

You have a lot of really interesting experience optimizing onboarding flows and the impact that's had. And then three is how to choose a company to work out. You've chosen a lot of really interesting companies and you have some cool insights around how to think about that. Does that sound good?\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah, it sounds great. I've also chosen some bad companies in my time too, so we can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nLenny: Okay, excited to hear about that. So first we talked about this briefly. You've started to do a lot more writing. You have this newsletter at fishmanafnewsletter.com, and you recently wrote this really epic piece called the Growth Competency Model, which essentially lays out what to look for in a growth leader, how to hire, how to evaluate, what to concentrate skills on? Things like that. First question, just what made you feel like you had to write this? What mistakes have you found founders make when hiring and evaluating growth leaders?",

And who they were meant how big is their audience on a bunch of the channels where they managed communities, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, YouTube, et cetera. And then how engaged was that audience?

So, it's like what are the strengths of that channel is something that... that is actually probably the piece I see people ignore the most, which is they just want to know if a channel is hot or not. And this gets especially hairy in this world of a lot of B2B doing more consumer-esque marketing. There's so many B2B companies that just don't apply to emerging consumer channels.\n\nAdam Grenier: And it's just like, please just stop. I don't need a Notion Clubhouse channel this week. And maybe there's a world to do that. But I think that's kind of number one, is making sure that there's even a reason that you should be there to put it on your radar right now.\n\nLenny: Awesome.

The big variables that can change that timing, so if I'm exploring a new video channel, the content I need to create is if I'm going to have to create something that takes three weeks to produce and $20,000 to make, I may want to give it a little more time, because I gave it more of an upfront investment.\n\nAdam Grenier: Versus if it's like I want to put text ads in podcasts listings or something like that. It's like, great, I can do that by myself at midnight and it's not distracting anybody or anything. And if it doesn't work in three weeks, let's move on. But generally ideally what you're working through, and we'll touch a little bit more on this with the Growth CMO, is that this should all be part of a roadmap. It shouldn't just be randomly chosen and thrown at. This should be part of your sprint process and you should have a backlog of other things that you want to try. And so you're actually weighing that decision of how long based on what other opportunities you're missing out on by investing in that.\n\nAdam Grenier: But I would say most channels, especially new ones, are going to take more than a couple cycles to kind of suss out. Because there's no rules, there's no playbooks yet on how to do them well. So, give it a little bit of time, but if you're going over a quarter and you don't feel like directionally it's getting better or it's interesting, I would put it back on ice for a while.",

Is there anything specific they can do to learn how to do this better, other than is it like mentorship? Is there classes, courses? Just do the job, figure it out?

There are tons of similarities of building AI systems and software systems as well, but then there are some things that kind of fundamentally change the way you build software systems versus AI systems. And one of them that most people tend to ignore is the non-determinism. You're pretty much working with a non-deterministic API as compared to traditional software. What does that mean and why does that have to affect us is in traditional software, you pretty much have a very well-mapped decision engine or workflow. Think of something like Booking.com. You have an intention that you want to make a booking in San Francisco for two nights, et cetera. The product has kind of been built so that your intention can be converted into a particular action and you kind of are clicking through a bunch of buttons, options, forms, and all of that, and you finally achieve your intention."

And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it."

What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time."

We're now in a world where the software you're building is one, non-deterministic, can just do things differently. As you said, you go to booking.com, you find a hotel, it's going to be the same experience every time. You'll see different hotels, but it's a predictable experience. With AI, you can't predict that it's going to be the exact same thing, the thing that you plan it to be every time. And then the other is there's this trade-off between agency and control. How much will the AI do for you versus how much should the person still be in charge? And what I'm hearing is the big point here is this significantly changes the way you should be building product. And we're going to talk about the impact on how the product development lifecycle should change as a result."

The product has kind of been built so that your intention can be converted into a particular action and you kind of are clicking through a bunch of buttons, options, forms, and all of that, and you finally achieve your intention.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: But now that layer in AI products has completely been replaced by a very fluid interface, which is mostly natural language, which means the user can literally come up with a ton of ways of saying or communicating their intentions. And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And with agentic systems, this kind of gets even harder. And that's where we talk about the second difference, which is the agency control trade-off. What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: So just to summarize what you're sharing here, essentially, people have been building product, software products for a long time. We're now in a world where the software you're building is one, non-deterministic, can just do things differently. As you said, you go to booking.com, you find a hotel, it's going to be the same experience every time. You'll see different hotels, but it's a predictable experience. With AI, you can't predict that it's going to be the exact same thing, the thing that you plan it to be every time. And then the other is there's this trade-off between agency and control. How much will the AI do for you versus how much should the person still be in charge? And what I'm hearing is the big point here is this significantly changes the way you should be building product. And we're going to talk about the impact on how the product development lifecycle should change as a result.",

So that is incredibly useful and we keep repeating this part and over and over with everyone we talk to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: And there's so many other benefits to limiting autonomy because there's just danger also of the thing doing too much for you and just messing up your, I don't know, your database, sending out all these emails you never expected. And there's like so many reasons this is a good idea.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Yep. I recently read this paper from a bunch of folks at UC Berkeley. Basically Matei Zaharia, [inaudible 00:21:54] and the folks at Databricks and it said about 74% or 75% of the enterprises that they had spoken to, their biggest problem was reliability. And that's also why they weren't comfortable deploying products to their end users or building customer facing products because they just weren't sure or they just weren't comfortable doing that and exposing their users to a bunch of these risks. And that's also why they think a lot of AI products today have to do with productivity because it's much low autonomy versus end-to-end agents that would replace workflows. And yeah, I love their work otherwise as well, but I think that's very in line with what at least we are seeing at my startup as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Okay. Very interesting. There's an episode that'll come out before this conversation where we go deep into another problem that this avoids, which is around prompt injection and jailbreaking and just how big of a risk that is for AI products where it's essentially an unsolved and unsolvable problem potentially. I'm not going to go down that track, but that's a pretty scary conversation we had that'll be out before this conversation.",

I was like, \"Why are you doing so much?\" And then he says, \"It trickles down into a bunch of decisions that we take.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Okay. Let me talk about another topic that's very ... It's been a hot topic on this podcast. It was a hot topic on Twitter for a while, evals. A lot of people are obsessed with evals, think they're the solution to a lot of problems in AI. A lot of people think they're overrated that you don't need evals. You can just feel the vibes and you'll be all right. What's your take on evals? How far does that take people in solving a lot of the problems that you talk about?\n\nKiriti Badam: In terms of what is going on in the community, I feel there's just this false dichotomy of this either evals is going to solve everything or online monitoring or production monitoring is going to solve everything. And I find no reason to trust one of the extremes in the sense that I will entirely bank my application on this or like that to solve the thing. So if you take a step back, think of what are evals. Evals are basically your trusted product thinking or your knowledge about the product that is going into this set of data sets that you're going to build in the sense that this is what matters to me. This is the kind of problems that my agent should not do and let me build a list of datasets so that I'm going to do well on those.

And this production monitoring has existed for products for a long time, just that now with the AI agents, you need to be monitoring a lot more granularity. It's not just the customer always giving you explicit feedback, but there is many implicit feedback that you can get. For example, in ChatGPT, if you are liking the answer, you can actually give a thumbs up. Or if you don't like the answer, sometimes customers don't give you thumbs down, but actually regenerate the answer. So that is a clear indication that the initial answer that regenerator is not meeting the customer's expectation. So these are the kind of implicit signals you always need to think about."

You basically go through all of these steps by step, a bunch of examples. And the idea here is, as you said, that the reason, everything about what you're describing here is about making it continuous and iterative and kind of moving along this progression of higher autonomy, less control. And this idea of even calling continuous calibration, continuous development is communicating it's this kind of iterative process. And just to be clear, this naming is kind of ode to CI/CD, continuous integration, continuous deployment suite. And the idea here is that this is the version of that for AI where instead of just integrating into unit tests and deploying constantly, it's running evals, looking at results, iterating on the metrics you're watching, figuring out where it's breaking and iterating on that. Awesome. Okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: So again, we'll point people to this post if they want to go deeper. That was a great overview.
