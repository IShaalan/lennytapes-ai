    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: It's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us. Which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.\n\nLenny: Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard [inaudible 00:00:42] experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ada Chen Rekhi. Ada is an executive coach and also the co-founder of a product called Notejoy. In her coaching practice, she focuses on helping founders scale themselves. Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame. In our conversation, it explains how to make better decisions with a framework she calls Curiosity Loops.\n\nLenny: We do a live exercise around my own personal values. She shares a bunch of advice on how to intentionally and practically build your early career path. How to thrive as a woman in Silicon Valley, when to get a coach and what you can do on your own without one and a ton more. Enjoy this episode with Ada Chen Rekhi after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny: This episode is brought to you by Sprig. Next generation product teams like, Robinhood, Notion and Loom rely on Sprig to uncover blind spots in their product development process. Sprig let's product teams collect user insights fast, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. One of the things I love most about Sprig is that they're all about getting product teams the specific insights they need in the timeframe that they need it.",

    "text": "Lenny: As of today's, Sprig is making that even easier with the new and improved templates library. On this podcast, you've heard a lot about how useful templates are for companies as they grow. Sprig partnered with some of the top product teams and product thinkers to build proven playbooks, specifically to solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today from how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow to troubleshooting drop off. Sprig helps you build better products. Sprig now has a library of more than 85 templates that you can use to get started collecting user insights quickly right in your app. I especially love that Sprig builds templates specifically for product teams, and I was really excited when they ask me to create a template around product sense.\n\nLenny: One of the questions they get most is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to build a playbook along with Sprig on how to do that based on my experience at Airbnb and from what I've learned interviewing top product folks like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to build your product sense. Explore my product sense playbook and the entire Sprig templates library and build better products faster. Check it out today at sprig.com/templates. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/templates. Ada, welcome to the podcast.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Thanks. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny: So I've heard such great things about you from a lot of people, including a bunch of guests that have been on the podcast. And you also have this really great event diagram of maybe an ideal guest for the podcast. You've done growth. You've done products. You've started a company. You're also an executive coach to founders. So there's a variety of topics I'm excited to begin too. So thanks again for being here.",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Yeah, I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny: An interesting thing that I'll start with is that when we were chatting about what to focus on in our conversation, where you're emailing about this, and you did something that I thought was really interesting. You ran something called a Curiosity Loop where you pinged a bunch of your friends and asked them for input in this really structured way. So I thought I'd start there. Could you just share what this process is, so that we can learn how to maybe do it ourselves, this idea of a curiosity loop?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: A curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, \"Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?\" And I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work. I don't normally do this, but I actually showed you some of the anonymized feedback from people really just talking about what resonated and what didn't. So I came out of it just so much smarter, and curiosity loops are my method of doing so.\n\nLenny: Often, people ask friends for advice on just like, \"Hey, what should I do here? What can I maybe talk about on this podcast?\" Your approach had a lot of structure to it. So maybe two questions just like, what is the actual structure to this concept? And then two, just people... You can often ask friends for advice, but you also don't want to over bug them with questions. How do you think about just not over asking everyone questions all the time, but all decisions you want to make? So I guess the question is, when do you use this versus just not?",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: I think that there are heavyweight and lightweight ways to use this. So the heavyweight way was what I just exemplified by saying, I sent an email and I made a doc. And on the other side, I had all of this really interesting and rich data. The lightweight way to do this is really just make it your ongoing theme of what you're curious about as you interact with people. So maybe it's this thing where every single day as you talk to people, if you have a social topic, you might just bring up the same question over and over again and start looking for are there any differences or surprises in what people are telling you? One of the big reasons why I think curiosity loops are really useful is that it really fights the fact that there's a lot of bad advice out there.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: And it's not bad because it's not well-intentioned, but it's bad because it's not contextual. So when someone tells you to quit your job and chase your dreams, or they tell you to sit tight and grind through and build some experience before you go off and go start the company that you've always been thinking about starting, which piece of advice do you actually take? Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question. In the time when I was working at SurveyMonkey in the past, I had this opportunity to spend a lot of time with the survey researchers, and we really talked a lot about what makes a question good.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So in this case, a question's good if it's specific, if it solicits rationale, and it's not biased. You don't want to start a question with, here's what I think because people have this tendency to want to please you or to agree with you. So a good example... Well, let me start with a bad example of a question. A bad example of a question is, what should I do with my career next? It's just such a poorly formed question because it's really vague, it's not specific. It puts a lot of cognitive load on other people, and the output that you're going to get from it is probably going to be similarly bad. Garbage in, garbage out. A better example of a question might be something like, \"Hey, you know me. I'm a marketer. I've been thinking about doing this webdev thing. So my plan is to quit my job, do a webdev bootcamp and then go find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea?\"\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: There's just so much rich data to actually explore with that. First, are you suited to being a developer? Are webdev boot camps effective? What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you. And then after that, you really want to ask the question. And this touches on what you said about how do you make it really lightweight?",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Ask the question in a way that really gets you a useful constructive answer, but doesn't put too much weight on people. So what I usually like to do is just make it very lightweight. So in your case, I said, \"Here are nine topics. Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?\" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, \"Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid.\" I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: And then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, \"You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much.\" That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision.\n\nLenny: So to summarize, I wrote these pieces down. The concept broadly is if you want advice on a decision you're trying to make, pick some friends and this is... I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I would try to optimize for getting at least three or four responses.

So we framed it in this professional context of, I'm trying to change a job. But one example that I have is when we had our daughter who's now three years old, one of the debates that my partner and I were having was how do we actually set up our estate planning in terms of if, God forbids, something happened to both of us. How should she inherit the state? And my partner was basically saying, \"18 years old, she gets everything fully unlocked.\" I was saying, \"Oh, well maybe 25.\" And we're at this impasse. And we actually just started to tell each other, why don't we, in our day-to-day conversations with folks that we trust in our family, people that we think are smart, that have kids ask people what their perspective is on it.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: One thing was really telling, no one out of everyone we asked said 18. So that really dragged my partner up. And then the other thing that was really interesting was that we learned a little bit about executive function and the research around it. So executive function, which is your ability to make decisions and plans and be thoughtful peaks at the age of 30, and it's all downhill from there.

So when I was working in marketing and product at a startup, one of the things we would always have is a group of our top customers on DM, basically. And if we had really interesting product conflicts, we would actually just go ping a couple of them and ask them, \"Hey, we're debating this. Do you mind just giving us your quick thoughts and telling us why?\" And then being able to as a marketer come back to the product conversation and say, here is the literal voice of the customer and four or five different verbatims on what people think about this really enabled me as a marketer to have a seat at the table. And the insight and the helpfulness of that was really something I wanted to bring to my personal life as well.\n\nLenny: That's really interesting. It's basically user research for your life. User research, you're told don't do what people tell you to do. I guess it's the same thing here, where it's just like, here's advice and then you end up making the decision for your own own life.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Right. Right. Yes. That is the big caveat. Don't do what people tell you to do. Take it as an input and look for the hard feedback. Look for things that you strongly disagree with or are surprises to you. Because to me, I think these loops are more about looking around the corner and seeing if there's anything you missed in terms of the integrity of your decision making process.\n\nLenny: Sweet.

And what I really like is, it's this internal scorecard of what really matters to you in your decision making process as opposed to the external scorecard of status, money, wealth, how other people perceive you, that often we feel really pressured by. So it's this great way to look back and see how well do decisions, or how well do my situations in life align with my values?\n\nLenny: Sweet. And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, \"Hey, come up with your values.\" I'd be like, \"Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking about words and concepts.\" And it was really helpful because it was basically multiple choice. Here's all the options across tons of categories, just keep picking and then helps you whittle them down. I ended up with six. I feel like that's one too many. Actually, I added a bonus one because it's just one that I really like. But should I read through what I came up with?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Yeah, that sounds great.\n\nLenny: So here's what my values, I guess. Choose adventure, stay optimistic, treat others you want to be treated. Classic. Keep getting better, act generously. And added one that my grandma taught me back in the day that has stuck with me, that had nothing to do with this exercise, but I just wanted to have on this list, which is, first do what you need to do, and then do what you want.",

Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, \"Why would I do anything more? This is good.\" So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?\n\nLenny: I'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out.

I do a bunch of angel investing and so I'm thinking about just stopping that for a while just so I get up more time with my new child and just carve out things that maybe aren't as essential.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So on the values exercise, I think what you've done a really good job of is just really delineating, here are some examples of choices that you have to make. I think that there are some points in our lives where writing a book, it just seems really obvious. It's good for your career. It's the next level in terms of where you go from the community, the newsletter, the podcast and getting to that next level. But where I think there is value is these lists of values can help ground us from those obvious decisions. So in my life, to share a mini example of this, there have been a lot of cases where the next obvious step for me might be to go an executive at a big company and to go chase the dream and continue on the latter climb of my career.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: As I've examined my own personal values, a big piece of it has really been around prioritizing relationships and really pursuing knowledge and growth on my own terms. And things like independence and autonomy have started to creep up over time, especially once I started a family. It became very clear to me that sometimes the external scorecard of what people think you should go do is very much an opposition of what I actually want to do. Even though it might be objectively better, depending on what scorecard you actually use, I would actually be less happy with some of those outcomes. So I think values are this really nice useful tool to think about how do you make better decisions again to maximize for your own alignment with life.\n\nLenny: That's such an important point. It connects back to the course that I taught and then this potential book of, it just feels like an obvious thing I should do. It was great, but it just didn't bring me joy. And other things bring me more joy. So it was a really good reminder of just like, do I really want to be doing this, or is this just a thing that feels like a smart thing to do but maybe isn't for me psychologically? So I love just the reminder of coming back to values as a lens to decide if you want to do a thing versus just, what are people telling you? Smart or...

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Explore and exploit, if you're familiar with it from growth background, is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more. And when I think about explore and exploit for early career, it's all about exploration. You really haven't experienced that much, but you're doing it with a thesis. You're doing it with that growth mindset where you have a hypothesis. So coming out of school, my first job was at Microsoft. I was at adCenter. The big thing I learned from the 367 days that I was there was that corporate life at that point in my career was just a little bit too slow-paced for me, and I was really hungry to go do something else.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: But I also learned quite a lot about marketing and advertising. And I had the suspicion that not only did I want to try something smaller, but I also wanted to try marketing. So I moved to this series a startup where I had to sample my desk on the first day called Mochi Media. And I was in a marketing role at a startup and had this great run there over three years, where I learned all kinds of things and even tried product at some point. What I learned from that experience was then I love marketing, games was pretty fun and being in a smaller team was really dynamic. It was this choice on, do I exploit and go deeper into the industry or do I explore more? I was 23 at the time, so I decided I have so little to lose, let me continue exploring. My big thesis was, let me try being a founder. So then I founded Connected, and Connected was this personal CRM that's a little bit like Clay.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: If you've seen Clay now recently, in terms of how do you do a better job of managing and building your professional and personal network and-\n\nLenny: Yeah.

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Yeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, \"I'm here to learn to be a better founder.\" So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel. And saw how all of those pieces and worked together from a financial planning and analysis stage to all of the optimizations that they did. It was just such a rare opportunity, but I wouldn't have gotten those opportunities if I just let them promote me or I followed a strategy where I was just focused on trying to get the biggest title.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Instead, I was focused on those learnings and those experiences. Ultimately, the fact that I was a startup founder. I had big company experience. I had growth experience, and I had subs experience. And I was a product marketer. That was actually the winning combination that caused SurveyMonkey to send me a LinkedIn InMail, start a conversation and ultimately bring me in as their head of marketing at the age of, I think I was 27 or 28 at the time. Because their rationale was, you have all these experiences that we really need and you don't have the management experience, but we have plenty of that. We're happy to teach that to you.",

    "text": "Lenny: I really like this framework. I've never heard it described this way. Explore and exploit connects a lot with what I always recommend which, early on, is to optimize for a variety of experience so that you can figure out where you actually have a good time and what you're interested in versus getting stuck on the first thing something. I don't know if you'll have an immediate answer to this, but I'm curious. Many people don't know how long to stick with something that maybe doesn't feel good but may lead to something. Like, someone may be in a job right now, or just like, \"I really don't like this job, but I feel like it'll lead to something great. And I don't want to give up too quickly.\" So I guess the question is, what are heuristics that tell you to stick it out and stick with something that you think will lead to something great versus hold the recording and get out?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: That's a great question, and it's a really tough one that is contextual on the person that you are. So one of the things that I like to share is this idea of, it's a little gory, don't be the frog. So if you are familiar with the story of the frog, it's this idea of boiling the frog. So if you take a frog, and you throw in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive. And how I apply this to your question to come back and circle back to it is that, it's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them or we think, \"Gosh, it'll get better. The next manager will get better. I'm always one conversation or one promotion away from getting to that next step.\"\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: But you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending. That's what makes the advice really contextual. I really look at it from the lens of learning. What can I learn here, and how am I growing and developing? So there might be an argument for you to stay at a job for two decades. If it turns out that every single day you're being really challenged, you're learning new things, you're deriving a lot of meaningful enjoyment out of your work and you're this happy frog that's hanging out, realizing that things are good and the temperature is not rising. But there are also situations where you might encounter just some really hard walls, where you don't get along with the thesis of the company. You don't agree with the direction of the company that you're in.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: There are fundamental aspects of the role which are limiting to you or you're not learning a lot, frankly. I think that happens a lot, where you providing a lot of value and doing a good job at a company, but you might not be learning things that stretch you and grow you to achieve your ultimate goal. When you are aware of that learning, I think that's the point at which you have to say, \"How do I change that? How do I be an agent in my own career and make a difference in that?\" And it doesn't necessarily mean that the strategy is to quit your job and do something catastrophic, and then go do something else, take a course or sign up for something new. It might actually mean a proactive conversation with your manager or the leadership to say, \"I love what I'm doing here, and I would also like to learn a little bit more. And here's what I'm interested in.\"",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Right. Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?\n\nLenny: Yeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this makes me think about is, it's so easy to get caught up in making your resume look amazing and continuing to just like, \"Oh, if I get this next role, my resume's going to look so great.\" And this other logo and this cool title and role. I find that just like, you do that long enough in your life, you end up... You retire, and then you die. Life is that resume. Right? That is your life, you're living, and there's not going to be a point at which you have to realize, okay, I've done all the things to make my resume. Also, I'm like, \"What do I actually want to do? Am I enjoying this?\" Because it'll never end. You're never going to end trying to make a better resume and a more awesome background for yourself. Do you experience that with yourself or other people you work with of just over optimizing to make an awesome series of roles and logos and then forgetting, do I actually enjoy any of this? What am I doing?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I have experienced that personally a lot. I think that it may be a generational thing or it just may be my background, but having grown up with the Asian tiger parenting, it's very focused on logos or certain accomplishments or certain achievements like, going to an Ivy League school, working in a company that someone's heard of, being able to have a certain title. At a certain point, I bailed out a bit and I really started to think about who am I trying to please and optimize for? That values exercise that I had you do, Lenny, is actually a big piece of that. So I probably took it for the first time over a decade ago, at this point. I looked at those values and I said, \"Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?\"\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: That's great. My parents might be happy about my resume or other people might look upon me in a certain way because I've managed these achievements, but in my day-to-day life, what really matters to me, what's really meaningful to me, only some of this stuff really matters. So getting very intentional about that and being clear about who your audience is as you navigate your career. I think it's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us, which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.",

You already heard me talk about how Sprig helps you uncover blind spots in your product development process, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. Just this week, they launched their brand new templates library, which you can find at sprig.com/templates. Which helps you plug and play proven playbooks for helping you identify and solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today. From how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow, to troubleshooting drop off. One of the questions I get most on this podcast and in my newsletter is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to work with Sprig to build a playbook for how to do just that, based on my experience at Airbnb and what I learned from interviewing top product people like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to develop your product sense, which informed this template that you'll find. Just go to sprig.com/templates to find this playbook and 85 more that is sprig.com/templates. S-P-R-I-G.com/plates.\n\nLenny: What triggered your reevaluation of that path? Was there just like a, \"Oh, man. I need to really rethink where I'm going.\" And then I have a follow-up question.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Really just a career opportunity. And it was this step where I could do something that was, at the time, really high profile and really exciting and felt great, but also involved demanding travel and grueling hours. And wasn't in a space that I was excited about, but it looked amazing on my resume. And I was talking to a friend about it, and they actually introduced me to this values exercise to say like, \"Ada, go through and fill out this values exercise, and apply it to this job.\" What I realized at the time, after I did it, was that my top three values, the things that I cared about this job would categorically just fail at because I would be gone all the time, in pursuit of glory that I didn't really care about. Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.\n\nLenny: It reminds me of a friend who has this metaphor of this ego monster sitting in the corner of the room that's always yelling at them, when they're... To do the thing that's impressive and take on the really cool role, and just get an awesome title, and do something really impressive, that's just like yelling at them from the corner. And my friend's just learned to just like, \"Okay, that's the ego monster pulling at me. I don't have to listen to that. Doesn't mean I'm going to be happy if I listen to this guy.\" And that's been really helpful to my friend just to disassociate that part of the brain.",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: Yeah. The ego monster is a great way to put it. I use something that Warren Buffet has talked about, which is inner scorecard versus outer scorecard.\n\nLenny: Tell me more.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So he talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you, how you keep score in terms of external factors. So top 10 lists, wealth status, title, maybe things that people really care about. And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you, how you spent your day, how good of a person you are. Did you have an adventure today, Lenny? Were you kind? And there are a lot of things that maybe are in opposition to each other. So really thinking about did you win at the cost of kindness? Did you succeed at the cost of losing access to the adventure that you really wanted? I think really thinking about it in that lens helps you trade off against some of that external pressure and the ego monster.\n\nLenny: This might be a good segue to chat about coaching. I imagine a lot of people listening to this like, \"Yes, I want to do that. I want to measure myself according to my values and check in on this. And am I doing the wrong path?\" It's hard to do just on your own, I find. And I think that's one of the benefits of an executive coach. So maybe we just chat about what should people know about coaching and getting a coach, and does everyone need a coach and how to think about the idea of getting a coach at some point in their career.",

Roll it forward six months, what have you gotten done in your coaching experience. What have you accomplished, and you're just... It's like, a home run. And then look at all of the potential alternatives in terms of how you could have spent your valuable time and often pricey fees to achieve the same goal, but maybe in a better way.\" The thing that people don't really think about is if you're looking for a mentor, a coach is actually a terrible mentor in some ways because it's this one person's opinion. It's actually way better to run a curiosity loop, for example, and get the benefit a couple different minds on a specific topic and hit their wheelhouse of things that they know about. Than to go ask one person, what do you think I should do in this situation?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: If you're trying to learn about a topic in a really robust way, let's say you want to learn about growth, maybe you should take are Reforge course and get access to all of the resources and the insights of the EIRs and the growth advisors that Reforge and get an overview and survey of the landscape instead of one person's experience and the handful of companies that they might have worked with. Likewise, if you're just feeling like you're a little emotionally overcome, I think coaches are this great resource around that, but it's actually better to pay it forward and build a tribe and a community of people around you that you can rely on for support because that's the thing that lasts you for years and years.",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: So one of the first things that I do when people talk to me about coaching is I challenge them and say, \"Have you explored all of these other opportunities first, and do you really need a coach? And is a coach actually the best option for you?\" Like an anti sell, just so that they know what they're getting themselves into because I don't necessarily think that it's useful for all things, even though it can be helpful.\n\nLenny: And then when do you find that it's actually important and valuable and something someone should try to get?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I wouldn't be a coach if I didn't think that it wasn't important and valuable. I think that in certain contexts it can be super helpful. So when you have situations where you're in a state of hyper growth, and you need very accelerated learning, and you need someone who can point you in the right direction, I think coaches can be really helpful. So I work with founders for example, and founders are just in this unique state where everything is chaos. They have no structure. They don't know what their jobs are. They have fully justified imposter syndrome where no one in their right mind would objectively have hired them for the position that they're in. There's really intense highs and lows. So for a founder, it might make a lot of sense to get a coach because they have to learn a lot of stuff really quickly, and time is of the essence.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So a coach might be a really helpful shortcut for them to get there. Related to that, I think it's also really helpful on sensitive topics. So there are a lot of things that we want to be coached on where either it takes a lot of time for us to work through and progress because it's a long-term project, for example, or it's something very sensitive. People issues and interpersonal conflicts. Coaches can be especially helpful in those cases because it's this really safe space for you to work through things, but also have someone who's really rational to help guide you through them with potentially some frameworks and extra advice.",

    "text": "Lenny: So I had a couple coaches in my career and what made me feel like I should pursue that is when you think about a sports athlete or, I don't know, athlete. No one does not have a coach, the best athletes have coaches and they get great because they have somebody helping them get better. It's not just like an accident. They don't just learn on their own. It just makes you realize that other people in their profession that have a coach helping them out are just going to be more successful because innately, they have someone helping them learn how to do the job better. So that made me realize, man, I should probably get a coach to help me out with stuff. Even though there wasn't anything super specific, I'm like, \"Oh, I need to fix this problem.\" It was just like, wow, this just intellectually make sense. So it was actually really important and transformative for me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: If you go to my site, I actually have this guide that I've written over time on both my take on how do you find a coach, and the TLDR there is actually that I strongly recommend to everyone. If you're thinking about getting a coach, talk to two or three different coaches. And really get a sense of their vibe and how well you get to know them. It's surprising because I did this piece of research, which I also wrote about, and we could link to, but I talked to over 80 people about their experiences with a coach. I talked including coaches, including founders, including executives and there's this shocking data point in there where half of people that founder their coach literally went with the first coach that they talked to. It's that your buddy said, \"I work with this great coach.\" And then you go and you hire your buddy's coach.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I think that's a totally fine way to go find a coach, but I would actually really just urge people to talk to a couple because what works for your friend may not work for you. And just being able to see some of the variance in terms of the style and how people get along, I think that can make a huge difference in terms of this reflection of how do you learn best? When you think about acquiring a new skill, do you love structure? Do you not like structure? Do you like it when someone really teaches you and walks you through specific examples, or do you frameworks? Coaches come in all of those different flavors. So I think it's really worth it to explore before you get into such a deep relationship with someone, just so that both people can feel really sure about it.\n\nLenny: What's one thing that people may not think about or just something that you find really important that maybe is unexpected when you're looking for a coach?",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: I thought that credentials and the relevant experience of the coach was a huge factor in terms of how you should go about your coach selection. But part of the interviews that I did was talking to founders that had had experiences with coaches and asking them to reflect back, and these founders and executives when they thought about it, they actually said so much more about, it was actually this amorphous sense of vibe with the person, how safe you felt with them, how deeply you would explore with them, and how well they got you, and remembered the pieces of the conversation and help you put it together. Way more than potentially some experiences that they'd had, where this person had the perfect background, but they just never really connected on that level. So it was unintuitive to me that there was such a big piece of it that was around personal connection, which is why I've now pushed people to try to talk to a couple different people.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: And then the other thing which comes back to the sports coaching analogy is that there are different coaches that are really good at different things. So just like how, if you're a star tennis player, you might actually have multiple coaches working with you, maybe an offensive coach or a defensive coach or working on a particular swing. It actually makes sense when you're really performing at a high level to consider having coaches that work with you on shorter term basis to really just work on your speaking or help you with getting into your groove on writing or help you achieve a specific goal. You shouldn't think about it as this long-term commitment to stay with one person, but instead more choosing off of a menu and thinking about what goal are you trying to achieve right now?\n\nLenny: Does anyone ever get multiple executive coaches that... I like how we went from, you don't need a coach to maybe need a month [inaudible 00:50:46] hamstrings.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Yes. I know of multiple people that I've talked to, usually CEOs, that either have had a series of coaches or have multiple coaches.

Okay. So let's touch on the thing that your friends said we shouldn't touch on, which is being a woman in leadership in Silicon Valley. I guess I'll just frame it simply. Imagine there's many young women listening to this podcast, and many may dream of a career like yours, all the things you've shared. What advice do you have for young women just starting out in their career hoping to find a similar path?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: This is a really delicate subject, and it's interesting because when I try to decompose why people gave me the feedback they gave me on this topic, I think a big piece of it is just that you want to have respect for the inherent challenges of being a non stereotypically great fit for leadership roles or certain career success roles in Silicon Valley and acknowledge that. And also try to push for some of the agency of the things that you can do. So I'm going to start with just this quick story about someone that I worked with who's given me permission to share this, in a coaching context and then back out. So I was working with a seed stage founder, and she's so smart. She is really dynamic, very, very focused, really, really great at taking feedback and actioning it. She's one of those people that is just stellar, and I have no doubt that she's going to make a huge dent in the universe.",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: We've been working together on Zoom for a couple of months, and I'd built this great respect for her competence as an operator, and the way that she thought and took apart problems and then acted on them. And then we met together for the first time in person at lunch. I feel almost nervous talking about this here. The disparity between my sense of who she was as an operator and how she came across to me initially at this lunch was really striking in that it was a weekday lunch and she was dressed as if she was hanging out on the weekend. So old T-shirt, hair back and in a claw, bra straps were showing. She was just incredibly casual in terms of her physical appearance. It took me almost like a little bit of a step back to reevaluate and think, \"Oh, this is the same person, but she actually just presents so differently.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So then I took the step after we met and I gave her that feedback in one of our next coaching sessions where we invited each other to give each other feedback. I shared a lot of my impressions with her and I told her, \"I respect you so much as an operator. I want to tell you that in the physical meeting that we had together, there was this disparity on how I would've potentially perceived you when I first met you in person versus what I've come to know about you from the months that we spent together.\"\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Her reaction was like, \"Oh my God, Ada. No one has ever connected the dots for me. Thank you so much. It has never explicitly been told to me that some of these elements which you describe, and they're very easy for me to fix and I'm motivated to fix them, are things that might actually trigger certain impressions or biases. No one's actually said it to me before, and I'm about to go into fundraising. It's actually super helpful for me to hear this, that these are controllable elements of my physical attire or my appearance that might actually just affect the way that people perceive me. And then it gives me this extra hump to get over, in terms of getting to this point of credibility for them to see me as a seasoned operator that I am.\" She took it so well. But what was interesting about it was actually that she'd made it all this way in her career. She'd even raised funding, and no one had ever given her this feedback.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: So this is, I think one of the big challenges of being a woman in Silicon Valley because getting to an executive role or getting to a funded founder role, it's like an Olympic level sport. You have to get all the way through the funnel and become one of the few that are really chosen to do that. But the difficulty of this game is that no one tells you the rules of the game. You actually don't really know what are the rules on how to get intros or give intros. What's the right way to follow up? What are the impressions that people have about you? It turns out that in a career context, it's so unsafe for your manager to turn to a young woman on the team and say, \"Here, let me give you feedback on your physical appearance, and how it affects your competence and how you're perceived in the workforce.\" That the vast majority of them will just never do it because there's no winning, which is similar to the feedback that I got.",

Whatever reason that you feel people may be disqualifying you or not seeing you. We're not powerless, even though this game is rigged. We can study the game, we can help each other, and we can actually start to call out some of those rules and then find ways around them. In this case, for the founder in this example, she really turned to her friends and did a mini makeover and amped up her appearance.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: And she came back and she reported, \"A lot of people have been giving me really positive feedback, that something about me feels more confident and more energetic, and they can't figure out why.\" But actually, she was getting a ton of people noticing that something was really different about her in a positive way simply because I was in this great position as her coach to give her some of these pieces of hard feedback that she had never heard before. So it's really on us to try to find those and then try to adapt ourselves to play that game if you want to play at that level.\n\nLenny: How nervous were you giving her that feedback?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I was so nervous. I actually almost didn't do it, and then took a deep breath and then decided, what the heck? I think she's great. I think she would really benefit from doing it and I gave it. Even in a position where I'm in a relationship with her where I can have that trust, it was super, super difficult. So I can only imagine how hard it is for people to give feedback like that in another context, but how else are people going to hear it?",

But I think on the topic of being female or on the topic of physical appearance or maybe even some of the topics around being an immigrant, if you're in a position where you can give that feedback, I think the struggle is often will it be well received? And that's where the feedback comes from me from the curiosity loop for this piece, which was there's almost no winning in doing it because the upside is something great happens for them. But there's just so many downsides to giving advice or giving someone input like that the default course is just to avoid. But then that person never learns the rules of the game.\n\nLenny: Yeah, absolutely. It makes me think also a little bit about Radical Candor, basically.

I think Sheryl Sandberg took her aside after one of her meetings and basically told her that, \"If you say um, it makes me sound stupid.\" And she didn't take that well, but at the same time, later on in retrospect, she reflected that it was so brave and so helpful of someone like Sheryl to go give that feedback because there's a real cost to it.

    "text": "Lenny: That's great.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: ... eating your vegetables is really this idea around how little kids don't really develop an appreciation for vegetables until they're 10 or 12 exposures in. So the researchers say, \"Expose kids to vegetables 10 or 12 times, even if they don't like it, because that's what it takes to get someone to like something.\" So when I think about career strategy and when I think about improving yourself and I think about how do we look for some of the hard feedback, eating your vegetables is this really important component of it because it's about how do you identify dislike for something because you're bad at it or you're new to it or you've never done it before, compared to genuine dislike where you've done it and you really don't like it. So to make it a little bit real, if we think about the world of podcasts, Lenny, I think it's something like 75 or 80% of podcasts never make it past the first podcast.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: You have to do things a number of times before you really develop an affinity for it. Because the first time you do it, you're just not going to be good. So my mini example of that was early on in my career, I was really awkward and not very good at networking. I moved to Silicon Valley and one of the things that people told me about Silicon Valley was that it's really important to grow your network. It's all about the people. Totally agree about that. However, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't really understand this networking thing. So I gave myself this rule where I had to go out once a week for a couple of months, go to an external event, and I would count out 10 business cards. And the rule was, I had to hand out all 10 of those business cards by introducing myself to people that were new, and touch the back wall of the venue of that event and then I could leave.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I did that a couple of weeks in a row, and it was horrible. It was really awful, but it got a lot better. What I realized about that was actually two things. One that, as I started going and I saw familiar faces, it became a lot easier for me to just break in and meet people, just by seeing who people I knew already were talking to. And then second, I got a lot better at just breaking in and introducing myself and understanding how this intro and networking thing worked in terms of meeting people and moving through a crowd. Some of those relationships now from that first job and those first couple months are pretty much foundational to the network and the people that I know today. So it really paid off for me because I really focused on eating my vegetables and powering through that initial discomfort.",

I also really like the physicality of that rule of touching the back wall. It just forces you to go through a room, and I just escape really quickly. Is there any other examples of things you've seen or recommend for doing things like, eating vegetables? That was a really good example of just forcing yourself to go to a networking event, touch the back wall. Is there anything else, any other examples that come to mind that you've recommended or found useful, doing something really hard that was really impactful?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Yeah. So there are actually a few of them. A lot of them around content creation because it's just so hard. So one of them that comes to mind is, I know a lot of people have talked about doing a LinkedIn 30. So 30 days of posting something on LinkedIn in terms of content every day for 30 days straight, and just getting past that barrier of sharing. And then looking at it over time and seeing out of the things that you posted, what really resonated. I also think it's helpful to start thinking about things like getting into DMs. Right. It takes a lot of work to think about, \"Oh, this person's really smart, let me DM them. Let me try to strike up a conversation because we're well out of the world of physical business cards.

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: But modern networking is finding people that are really interesting on the internet and then finding some way to connect with them. It takes a certain amount of extroversion in that case to start meeting up with people and having conversations with them. So forcing yourself in some way to really think about, \"Well, instead of having one outreach and then failing at it and saying, 'I'm never doing that again.' How do I actually create a pattern where I can learn or a sequence of trying to do this 10 or 12 times, and see what I get out of it?\" Because that's really how you learn and how you grow.\n\nLenny: The LinkedIn 30 idea, I like a lot. Something that I'll share as a tip is when you hear that, I bet a lot of people are just like, \"Oh, my God. Going to link post on LinkedIn. So cringey. I don't want to be this self-promotiony LinkedIn person.\" But what I find is if you reframe it to, \"I just want to crystallize a thought that I have and just share something that is useful to me or an insight I've had, and not think of it from, I'm trying to get as many likes. I'm trying to go viral with this post, or I'm trying to just build some following.\" Just don't think of it that way. Think of it as just want to communicate a thought I have and use this opportunity to crystallize it in a really simple way. That helps motivate. That, at least, works for me. It also ends up being useful for me. It's not like I'm trying to grow some following as a result of that.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: I find that really helpful as well. One piece of advice that's similar to that that I've heard is, write for an audience of one. Imagine you're just talking to a friend or you're trying to talk to someone that's a trusted colleague, and just write for them. I think that's really helpful, and it helps us with the problem of getting in over your skis, really over fixating on the outcome of, I did a post and I didn't get my 5,000 followers. And instead, just thinking about I did a post because I wanted to share an interesting idea, and then how cool, some people resonated with it.\n\nLenny: Yeah, I love that. You could just even say, something I found useful day one and just approach it that way. That's the stuff that end up being most interesting to people. The less it feels like you're trying to be thirsty for followers and likes and all that stuff. And the more it's just like, here's the thing I've found useful. Enjoy it, if you can.",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: ... I think it really just goes back to what I was talking about earlier where being a founder is such a traumatic and crazy experience with all these intense highs and lows and lack of structure that when you throw romance into the mix, it's just this really volatile combination. So what I've found is that it seems like it either goes really well or it goes really badly, and there's no in between. And asterisks are there because we've actually had a couple of friends try it, and it's been such a mixed bag of results. So my personal experience is I love it. My partner Sachin, and I work really well together. And the main benefit that we have is that the active founding is such an active obsession that you spend so much of your time thinking about your business and the concepts of your business and whatever problem you happen to be facing.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: That when I had this thesis of I want to be a founder too, we played it out and said, \"Well, okay, now we're going to walk around being obsessed about two completely different things. We may never see each other, and so why not try the same thing?\" So our first experiment was actually trying it together, and we were nuts. I actually had a 30, 60 and 90 day plan where we would have check-ins. And some of the explicit questions in the check-in, is this affecting our relationship? Because I just wanted to make sure we were putting our relationship first. It worked well for us to the extent that we've done two companies together. And then when we were at LinkedIn, we actually moved across multiple teams in the company and continued to be counterparts and product and marketing together. So it's been phenomenal. The thing that I would say really helps us in terms of making it a successful relationship was things that I think apply to anyone that's thinking about, should you work with a person and should you be a co-founder with this person?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: We had a very, very good set of complimentary domains and skillsets, so we had really clear decision making rights. Sachin does product design and engineering. I focus on marketing, operations, finance, everything else on the business side. And because of that, it's really clear that we take input from each other, but ultimately who makes the call and who's driving and owning that project. So that was really helpful for us. And then the big part that I think is the murky Meyer for couples and maybe even for close friends working together is how do you engage in constructive conflict? How do you get to the point where you're attacking the problem and not each other? So if your partner comes to you and says that work was not good, that marketing plan or that product roadmap that you put together, not good, do you take it as the plan is not good and let's talk about what we can actually do to fix it?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Or do you take it as, \"Oh, gosh, they think I'm not good. They think I'm too lazy. I saw that look that they were giving me.\" And take it as this personal offense. So the ability to be really truth seeking and take the most respectful interpretation when you're giving feedback to focus on trying to get to a smart good outcome that benefits the business, I think that's actually one of the most crucial things that you have to think about. If you're going to work with anyone. Much less your partner or a close friend on starting a company and what's really worked for us,",

It's a great book, if you're a founder or product person. But it really is a breakdown of what are the different strategies to get people to say yes and help persuade them toward things. I think it really helps in terms of thinking through that and designing a product or a business around it.\n\nLenny: I've got that in my bookshelf behind me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Oh, yeah. It's a great book. Yeah. The next book that I also recommend is a book called Designing Your Life, and it's out of the Stanford Design School. And it's by, let me look, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They're two Stanford D School professors, and what they're doing is they're applying design principles to life design. So how do you actually map that next level career that's both meaningful and fulfilling and also achieves maybe some of the success factors that you really care about, and brainstorm and be really creative about it. So when people are stuck or thinking about career strategy, that's actually one of the books that I always point out for them.",

What's a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: What's a common misconception people have about you? I usually like to throw that in toward the end of the interview, and the reason why I think it's really useful is it's a way for me to reset my bias. I may have had a certain impression about them, and this is their opportunity to speak up and say, \"Hey, a lot of people think this about me, but it's not true.\" It's also this reflection of their self-awareness.\n\nLenny: Great. What are some products that you've recently discovered or use regularly, SaaS products or even consumer fun random products that you want to share?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Yeah. I can't go through this podcast without giving a shout-out to Notejoy. So Notejoy is a fast and focused notes app for individuals and teams. So that's the company that I work on. So I use it for everything from Noora product roadmaps to my coaching notes, to even prepping for something like this podcast. I use Notejoy all the time. Another one that I really use a lot is Captio. It's been around for a while, but it's a little iOS app. I don't know if it's on Android, but basically it's a blank notepad. You can dump your brain into it, and there's one button, and it emails it to you. So when I find that I'm really distracted, or I just want to remember something, I use Captio all the time just to quickly capture my ideas. And then I process it later in my inbox.",

    "text": "Ada Chen Rekhi: And then something that I just downloaded this week is Arc, the new browser. I'm actually really excited about its vision. I'm not sure if I'm going to work it into my workflow yet or how it fits in, but it's really beautiful and it's really cool to see someone iterating on the cluster that is browser tabs.\n\nLenny: Yep. Love Arc. Went deep on Arc in the previous episode and I used Captio, however you call it. And I found another app, actually, the similar thing that I found even more simple. It's called Note to Self, just sits on my doc. Anytime I want to email myself a thought, I open it up and this type of thing. Somehow, it ends up being even easier. So that's another one to check out, Note to Self. Final question. You're really big on productivity. What's one tip that you found that has been really helpful for you in your day-to-day life, being more productive?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi: Figure out, maybe the night before, the one thing that you want to get done in your day, and then at the earliest opportunity, just try to give yourself five minutes on it. Just five minutes. And the reason why I say five minutes is that there is this challenge that I experience and maybe other people experience as well, which is really just productive procrastination. Even though I know something is really important that needs to get done, I will often do other things that are useful and need to get done simply because I'm avoiding that one thing. And then before you know it's the end of the day and I'm like, \"I still have to go do that thing.\" By really focusing on what's the number one thing and then just getting started on it a little bit. It just makes it really lightweight. And usually, what I find is that five minutes turns into a solid hour just knocking that thing out early in my day, and I feel really accomplished. But it's a mental hurdle that I really struggle with.\n\nLenny: I really like the approach of the five minutes because that's such a trick to get you to like, \"All right, I'll just do five minutes. I got to get this done.\"",

    "text": "Adam Fishman: Onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product, right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.\n\nLenny: Adam Fishman was the first growth and marketing hire at Lyft where he spent two and a half years leading their growth efforts. Then he went on to lead product and growth at Patreon, where he spent over four years building one of the most successful and lasting created platforms out there. And most recently, he was CPO at Imperfect Foods. Today he spends his time advising companies on product and growth, and he's also doing a lot more writing.\n\nLenny: And in this episode we cover three things, his growth competency model, which helps you hire and evaluate growth talent and also get a job as a growth person. We go deep into why onboarding is such an underappreciated growth lever and all of the impact that you can have optimizing your onboarding flow. Adam also shares a super cool framework for choosing which company to work at. Adam is hilarious and he's so full of wisdom and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Adam Fishman.\n\nLenny: This episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing, it's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.",

And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that.

    "text": "Adam Fishman: Yeah, I have seen it. I actually read the book first. I've been a pretty big fan of Mike Isaac, who's the New York Times reporter who wrote it. So I've been a big fan of his reporting for a long time. I connected with him a bit while he was writing the book, and I would say, there were parts of it that were painful. It was like renavigating, relitigating a history that I had lived through already. And so much of that story was stuff that I had experienced pretty regularly while I was at Lyft battling against Uber.\n\nAdam Fishman: So one part of me was like, \"I remember that. God, that was hard.\" Another part of me was happy to see that all of the things were out in the open finally, things that were hard to talk about about competitive practices and stuff like that and just shady things. And some part of me was happy that it was out there. And then one other thing separately, so I actually was interviewing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt to be an advisor with his company HitRecord while he was filming Super Bumped.\n\nAdam Fishman: And we had this conversation over Zoom when he was on break in between scenes of filming the show. And for those who don't know, he's the guy that plays Travis Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber. So he did this interview with me and he was in his trailer on set, fully decked out as TK in his look with his hair slicked back. And it was really funny and also cool to see him in this context. And he is probably the polar opposite from Travis Kalanick. Obviously they're both super successful, but JGL is a really down to earth, nice, very family-oriented calm guy. So anyways, this is a funny story of my time meeting and interviewing with him.\n\nLenny: That is amazing. Did you slip in a couple Lyft facts to help Lyft look a little happier and better?",

One is your growth competency model, which essentially is this post you wrote recently that tells founders how to hire and how to evaluate growth people. Two, I want to chat about onboarding flows. You have a lot of really interesting experience optimizing onboarding flows and the impact that's had. And then three is how to choose a company to work out. You've chosen a lot of really interesting companies and you have some cool insights around how to think about that. Does that sound good?\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah, it sounds great. I've also chosen some bad companies in my time too, so we can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nLenny: Okay, excited to hear about that. So first we talked about this briefly. You've started to do a lot more writing. You have this newsletter at fishmanafnewsletter.com, and you recently wrote this really epic piece called the Growth Competency Model, which essentially lays out what to look for in a growth leader, how to hire, how to evaluate, what to concentrate skills on? Things like that. First question, just what made you feel like you had to write this? What mistakes have you found founders make when hiring and evaluating growth leaders?",

    "text": "Adam Fishman: Yeah, so first I'm going to put up my new background here, which is my growth competency model background. For those watching on YouTube, I have a funny graphic in the background for this. So I guess the reason that I wrote this, there were a few reasons that I wrote it. One is it really felt necessary to write it. And at first it's, I don't think I've ever come across this type of canonical reference before around how to hire and plan for growth. So that's number one. I didn't think it existed. It needed to exist.\n\nAdam Fishman: Two, as an advisor and someone who has held the head of growth role many times, I get asked this question a lot. I get asked all the time about how do you hire growth people? And it's usually something like, \"Hey, how do we find you but 10 years earlier in your career?\" And it feels like that question is missing the first principles approach to hiring a growth person. And if you're doing that, you're just pattern matching to me. And I may not be the best person, right, or somebody who looks like me may not be the best person. So I think we're missing that.\n\nAdam Fishman: And then third, one of the programs that I'm currently creating is around growth leadership. And so I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to be an exceptional growth leader, how you hire other people onto your team and create balanced teams. And this is going to be a really important component of that program. So it was just really top of mind. So yeah, that's why I wrote it.\n\nLenny: Let me ask one quick question and I think you were about to start answering one mistakes founders make, but I guess it's less of a question. I know this was built on another model for product management, which is really awesome. And I love that there's this growing fountain of career ladders, competencies per function. And so I don't know if there's been one that's really great for design and engineering, but I love that this is happening. And so first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you put in the time to think this through.",

    "text": "Adam Fishman: Cool. Thank you. Yeah, and I do think we need more of these. I think we need one for marketers, I think we need one for engineers, designers, research probably, there's probably a bunch of functions that could benefit from some canonicalized resource around this stuff. So yeah, some myths and mistakes that I think founders made and that I've made. I've definitely lived through some mistakes. A few experiences where I was hired into a company where the founder had really messed up expectations of what a growth person should be doing, what I should be doing. And I wanted to set the record straight for founders because they are the folks who hire for this and other leaders.\n\nAdam Fishman: So one example that comes to mind is, I did a very brief stint at a company called Wyzant, in between Lyft and Patreon. And the founders of that company, so Wyzant was a tutoring marketplace. It was acquired by a company not too long ago, so it's now part of a bigger learning company. And the founders of that company we're looking for what I would call a silver bullet strategy to their growth challenges. And what they really needed, and I was naive and didn't think about asking these questions or about evaluating this properly, what they really needed was to create a strategy to add on new growth loops and a system for how to execute against that strategy.\n\nAdam Fishman: If we had talked about that as part of evaluating each other, as part of them evaluating me, it would've given me a lot of confidence that it was the right hire to make. But the problem was they didn't approach it that way. They didn't ask me those questions and I was too naive to recognize that, \"Hey, they're not actually evaluating this with the competencies that you would expect for a growth leader.\" Executing a growth strategy takes time and patience, and they didn't really have it. And overall it ended rather unsuccessfully. I helped them build this office in San Francisco, hired a bunch of folks, we actually closed down the office. I had to lay off a bunch of the people that I'd hired, including myself, which wasn't particularly fun. And I think all of it comes back to that they didn't have a really strong set of criteria on what it meant to hire a great growth person. And so if I can help even just a little bit with founders making that decision better, it'll lead to fewer mismatches I think in the hiring process.\n\nLenny: Awesome. Let's get into it. What are the components of this model? And you can put it back up again for folks to follow along in the background.",

And I think that answer of what are the components, what should people look for, really, I'll give the PM answer, which is it depends. And what does it depend on? It depends on the state of the team and where the skill gaps are. So the goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist. I am not an 11 out of 10 on these skills and I have been a growth executive at many companies. I consider myself to be pretty good at the job. The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team and that you don't have any gaps in your portfolio.\n\nAdam Fishman: And so when you think about it, there are four main components to the growth competency model. And the four big components or buckets are growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and then the last one is communication and influence. And each of those has three really specific skills. And so to give an example, let's break down growth execution for example, which is one of the very first ones that you should be good at if you're a growth practitioner. Within this competency grouping, there's three individual competencies that are channel fluency, experimentation, and what I'd call productizing learnings. And so you can evaluate and ask questions to understand how good people are at these different things and what their experience has been with them.",

And you want to find somebody who has a track record of at least understanding how to take something they have learned that might be an experiment or something that's very NVP and turn that into something that has hooks into different areas of the product. And so that's a critical skill to evaluate. And one of an example, the overall set of competencies.\n\nLenny: To throw in a question real quick, is one way to use this model, coming back to your Wyzant example where there's of course misalignment between you and the founder to sit down and look at this circle here and be like, \"Here's where I'm strong, here's where maybe we need to hire someone to take over.\"\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah, absolutely. You can almost use it as a reverse interviewing characteristic and say, \"What are the competencies you, founder, CEO, care about? What's really important to you for the first person in this role? Or the expectations that you have of what I will bring to the table.\" And then you can be really candid about what you're good at and what you're not good at, where you're developing.

This is going to be the title of the podcast.\n\nAdam Fishman: Awesome. So like user psychology, I think one of the things that people don't easily understand is that most people come to your product with an emotional frame and a lot of people want to appeal to their logical brain right away. And the reality is, don't do that. And so you have to understand the mindset that people are in. How low are their lows? How high are their highs? Why are they seeking out your product? And it often, as I mentioned, stems from some emotional challenge that they're having or something that they're seeking. And it's not because your product is the best chat bot or because it gives the best answers. There's a different thing that they're trying to solve. And only when you address that can you move on to those other things. So that's the second competency is, customer knowledge.\n\nLenny: It reminds me of something I mentioned on some podcast recently, this tweet that one of the Collison brothers tweeted about how user research is often misunderstood in that people think you do user research and that informs what you build. And instead the way you think about it is user research informs your model of your customer and that model informs what you build.",

And now the third and fourth competencies I would say are a bit more advanced topics. And again, remember when I said people index higher or lower on these as they go across their career, I would expect a more junior growth person to not necessarily be a 10 out of 10 on strategy and communication. These are things that you really have to work at a long time. They tend to be softer skills in a lot of cases and you learn best by either getting it very right or getting it very wrong. And so you've got to put in the time to develop these. But in growth strategy, there's three. The first one is growth loop modeling. So really understanding how you grow and where you should be spending your time. What acquires users? What retains them? What monetizes them?\n\nAdam Fishman: The second one is capital allocation and forecasting. This is basically where are you deploying either your money, your people, how are you managing the portfolio and how are you projecting that out into the future? And that's a really hard one. You have to become best buddies with your finance friends in order to do that. And so anyways, that's capital allocation and forecasting. And then the third one is prioritization and road mapping. So you have to be able to sequence the work much like in building a product, right? Building your growth strategy, you have to sequence it. That sequence has to make sense based on your growth models. You have to have the capital or the people to allocate to that stuff. And you have to be able to build a series of hypotheses in a series of solutions to test against those hypotheses so that you can learn and then productize to those learnings.",

And then the fourth one is communication and influence.\n\nAdam Fishman: And I would say, I think you probably know this as a PM, influence is one of the biggest and hardest skills to develop. It's no different in a growth practitioner and in some cases it can even be harder because sometimes people come in with a preconceived notion of what growth is and isn't and you have to change their mind. And so within communication and influence, there's strategic communication. So how do a series of experiments and a series of things that you're trying, fit into the overall picture of a bigger bet that you're taking?\n\nAdam Fishman: How do you lead a team? So team leadership is a big part of communication and influence. And then how do you manage stakeholders? And this is hard in growth because often growth can be viewed as at odds with really thoughtful and quality craftsmanship and product building, but it's not. Those things go hand in hand. And so you really have to win people over on what it means to do growth. And I would say, this is the pinnacle, right? This is the hardest one. It's a lifelong journey. It relies very extensively on understanding people and who you're talking to. And those people can be very different from company to company and the currency that they trade in can be really different. And so this one is one where you have to go back to square one and relearn who the people are that you're working with every time you step into a new role or a new company or get a new leader or something like that. So it can be really challenging and it's never done.\n\nLenny: That component of the competency models, we're the PM of the growth PM role feels like if you were to do these Venn diagram of the two roles, feels like that's a big part of the overlap.",

But also you don't want me, I think, when you're doing this for the first time. So I think the key there is smart and driven people for sure. Age and youth is a bit relative I'd say. So I would think about hiring somebody who you might say is less experienced in growth, but they could be very senior in another aspect of their career. You can also benefit from hiring somebody internally who wants to branch out into growth. And one of the benefits that you get from that is a lot of time they have one of those competencies really nailed already. Could be like customer knowledge. They might understand your customer base super well because they're already inside the company.\n\nAdam Fishman: So if you're going to hire a junior person, the key is, how do you help them learn? And I think if you don't know what you're doing as the founder or the leader, it's hard. You're not going to be able to help them yourself. So you've got to be willing to invest in advisors like me, outside education, mentorship, coaching, otherwise, what's going to happen is that very driven, hungry and enthusiastic person is going to run through a lot of brick walls, which is great, except they're going to miss the fact that the door was standing right next to the wall that they just ran through and you're going to end up with a lot of bricks on the ground.\n\nLenny: Excellent metaphor.\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah, thank you. And so I have some examples of both hiring people and moving people over in my career. So I think tangible examples are really helpful here. So when I was at Lyft, I had the privilege of hiring that young, smart and driven person a bunch of times, but one of the people who comes to mind is a guy named Ben Lauzier. You should have him on the podcast at some point. He's French, he's very nice to listen to you. He was most recently a VP of product at Thumbtack, but he was definitely not that when I hired him, he was a jack of all trades marketer working at a corporate catering startup when I hired him at Lyft.

And also, he was just very thoughtful about how he executed, how he experimented. He had done a lot of it and he was very skilled at pulling them off in a very small environment because he had just had to be. And those are the two most important competencies when you're bringing in a younger, earlier stage person because teaching somebody how to execute is not that fun, right? That's a hard skill. The ability to execute is something like executive function skills and things like that. If you haven't developed those by the time you are an adult, I don't know that I'm going to be able to teach you and I'm certainly probably not the right person to teach you. You should definitely get some outside assistance with that. And so I like to get those types of people that have those things if I'm hiring that generally inexperienced growth practitioner.\n\nLenny: And the two things you said are customer knowledge and execution. Is that the two you said?\n\nAdam Fishman: Yes. Customer knowledge and growth execution. And so let me tell you an execution story about Ben really quick. This comes also down to work ethic too. So we interviewed Ben and it was a long day of interviews in a tiny glass conference room and Lyft was, I don't know, 30 people or something at the time. At one of the interview breaks, Ben had come over and he didn't have his computer and anything like that. And so he was ducking out of work to do the interview. And he actually came out of the office and he's like, \"Hey, does anybody have a computer that I can borrow?\" And so we gave him this old crappy Chromebook and I was like, \"Why do you need a computer?\" And he's like, \"I have to go edit this file and do this thing and check something in at work and deploy this thing or whatever.\"\n\nAdam Fishman: And I'm like, \"Wow, this is a guy that really knows how to get stuff done and is so much so that he's pausing his interview process so that he could go get a thing done for his company that he's actively trying to leave, but he's got this work ethic and this execution.\" And that really stuck with me.

He'd spent tons of time talking to people, studying data and things like that. And he had really great fluency with data and a drive to continue improving his ability to access and pull out insights and information. And so he turned out to be really great, but just a very different profile of a person than Ben was. And here's an internal hire versus an external hire.\n\nAdam Fishman: So you can have success with both, but I think you really have to make sure that there's some foundational things that are in place like that ability to get customer knowledge and execute.",

    "text": "Lenny: If a founder is listening and trying to decide or hiring a head of growth or a new growth person, would you push them one way or the other, internal hire versus finding someone up and coming and smart?\n\nAdam Fishman: I tend to skew more towards internal hire to be perfectly honest, because I believe in creating opportunity inside a company. I think it's not done often enough. And I also believe that helping people transition into new roles is a way to get more people into the practice. And one of the ways that can happen is if you take a chance on somebody who has demonstrated a good track record in some other aspect of your business. So I tend to recommend internal. I think you have faster time to results. I think you know what you're getting better and in much less likelihood of making the wrong hire there. So I bias towards internal hires.\n\nLenny: Awesome. And I think partly, I feel that too because there's so much content and training for growth these days that somebody has that background in your company and is already motivated and excited and then can just learn, go to Reforge course, read certain newsletters, feels like it's a lot easier to ramp up. Except, I always feel like if you need someone for SEO or paid growth, that's a hard thing to learn. What's your take there?\n\nAdam Fishman: I would bucket that type of person into a specialist. And one of the archetypes that I talk about is this idea of the painter versus the architect versus the surgeon. And the surgeon is your precision person. I don't actually recommend hiring that as your first hire, but when you are onto something and you really need expertise and you don't have that expertise internally, yes, I think hiring externally is the right thing to do at that point because those are really specific skills that some people have taken years to learn. And I can't just teach someone SEO over the course of a weekend and expect that they're really going to get it. In those cases, I think hiring that specialist or that surgeon is the right approach, once you've got some of the foundational stuff in place.",

    "text": "Lenny: Awesome. Great. Yeah, it feels like there's still a lot of dark art in those two specialties that take years of experience.\n\nLenny: This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on Apple to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.\n\nLenny: Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead, you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, gete-p-p-o.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny: This is a good time to segue to our second topic, which is onboarding. I know you're a big proponent of spending time on onboarding, optimizing onboarding. How have you found onboarding to be as a lever for growth and just what gets you excited about investing in onboarding?",

    "text": "Adam Fishman: I love onboarding. I probably do at least an onboarding project to at least one with every company that I've worked for and a lot that I advise. The first thing I would say is, onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace.\n\nAdam Fishman: So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.\n\nAdam Fishman: And the third thing I would say is it's also probably the most motivated that someone is going to be about your product since they're typically starting their onboarding journey with you at a time where they're like, \"I need this thing really badly that you're selling.\" And so they're really motivated, right? And so it's an opportunity for you to put some friction in place and learn a lot about them because they will knock down doors to get to your product. So that's why I think it's a super powerful lever for growth. And we worked on this extensively at Lyft, at Patreon, Wyzant, Imperfect Foods just released some onboarding improvements that we had created when I was there, which was nice to see that finally come to light. So yeah, I've done this pretty much everywhere at some point.\n\nLenny: What impact have you seen from working on onboarding to give people a sense of like, \"Wow, this is what I can get if I put some time here.\"",

    "text": "Adam Fishman: Yeah. One of the things that onboarding really drives is habit formation with the product, which leads to retention. And so you should expect to improve your overall cohort retention curves by focusing on the onboarding and activation experience. I have seen companies shift their curve outward by 10, 15, 20 percentage points from making those changes, especially when you consider that churn is most likely to happen in the very earliest usage of the product. If you can get people past that hump, it's a really invaluable part of the product to work on.\n\nAdam Fishman: So I'll give you a really concrete example. At Patreon, one of the places we worked on onboarding really extensively and the onboarding experience was one of the teams that we had on growth at Patreon. We did a lot of experimentation around the earliest, what we would call product led sales now, when do you connect a human being with a creator and the onboarding experience and what is that impact and how do you connect them with the right person or with the right creator when there are tens of thousands going through that onboarding journey every week?\n\nAdam Fishman: What we realized through a lot of experimentation was the idea of connecting someone with a human being the right person at the right time would improve the first month of revenue or the second month of revenue that a creator made on the platform by 25%. Why that mattered is because the second month that you processed payments on the platform was a key input into your LTV on the platform. So by improving a creator's first and second month revenue by 25%, we were then able to improve their overall value on Patreon by an equivalent amount, which is pretty massive. Moving anything by 25% is really impressive.\n\nAdam Fishman: And so that was human intervention, and then we actually started to productize the stuff that the humans were doing. And so what is not scalable when you're using people becomes very scalable if you can replicate components of that with technology. And so that was the next phase, so we get back to that growth execution thing that I talked about and productizing learnings. That is an example of how you go from, we've learned some things by humans that have made a 25% impact to now we're building these into the product. And so that's a really good example I think, of Patreon and one of the impacts that we had on creator, earnings, retention and their overall success on the platform.",

Is there anything more you could share there that might be useful to folks?\n\nAdam Fishman: Gosh, we did so much. So I'll try to pull out a couple of example. So one of the things that we did, and again, I spoke to the fact that people are really motivated in your onboarding experience, one of the first things we did was we tried to identify better who a creator was in the onboarding experience. And who they were meant how big is their audience on a bunch of the channels where they managed communities, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, YouTube, et cetera. And then how engaged was that audience? It's one thing if you make crazy cat videos on YouTube and you have a million subscribers, it's another thing if every time you publish a video, all million of those people watch it, comment on it, share it, et cetera.\n\nAdam Fishman: And so we would ask creators to connect various accounts to Patreon, maybe through authoring with YouTube or Spotify or Instagram or Facebook or something like that, Twitter, and then we would pull in the data into our backend and identify people who had large followings and also heavily engaged followings, based on a set of criteria per channel. And again, this was not just like me inventing this. We had a data scientist team that we worked very closely with to figure out what was important and what wasn't in this model. And then if you were one of those people that had a high propensity for success, high potential creators, we would siphon them off from the regular self-guided onboarding and basically land them in the lap of a human being who could engage with them, reach out, get them even more excited and start talking to them about the best things to do.\n\nAdam Fishman: And then the productization of that, the best things to do turned out to be things like one of our product principles, which became opinionated defaults, which is basically making it hard to do the wrong thing when you're setting up your Patreon page and easy to do the right thing but not eliminating choice.",

So at Airbnb we had a bunch of calendar settings when a host signs up, on the host side is where I spent a lot of my time, we had instant book, which is basically you sign up as a host and people can book you instantly. That became the default for Airbnb. And so to make that successful, hosts had to have their calendar be accurate from the beginning. And so what we got to eventually, is we tried to figure out, are you a professional host that knows what you're doing? Are you a mom and pop that's just trying this out? And then based on that, either block your entire calendar, keep it all open, or somewhere in between.\n\nLenny: And it's interesting that it connects to your point about, and I was going to come back to this that, a lot of people think of onboarding as a conversion opportunity and it definitely is. But to your point, even more interestingly, it's a retention opportunity because in the Airbnb case, hosts sign up, they get booked for a day, they don't want to host, they're like, \"Shit, what the hell's going on here?

So you might actually have fewer people getting all the way through successfully, but I think that's okay because a lot of those people were probably not the right people for your product, which means they wouldn't have been engaged customers, they probably would have churned. So just by the nature of actually weeding out some people, you're going to improve retention because the people who are going through are the people who are much more highly qualified. And so I think that's also why onboarding is so challenging because you have to figure out what that sweet spot is, right?\n\nAdam Fishman: You could actually reduce conversion to a point where it's not offset by improvements in retention and you'd be doing the wrong thing. So when you're experimenting, you have to look at these push and pull metrics of these opposing metrics. But overall, I find that the biggest impact that you'll have is on retaining users because you are trying to connect them to the value that your product offers and form a habit. And if you form that habit early on, they're going to stick around because they're going to get it, they're going to get the benefit of the product, and they're going to be excited to stay and then tell more people about it. So that's why I think it's a much bigger impact on retention than conversion.\n\nLenny: Obviously retention is a longer tail metric and conversion is immediate.\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah.",

I think the answer is not wait 90 days to find out, right? Nobody has that time. And so what I tend to do is look at proxy metrics. So there are proxies for things like 90 day retention. As an example at Patreon, one of our proxies around the eventual success of a creator was how quickly they would reach certain dollar thresholds once they launched. And so your velocity to get to your first patron, your first a hundred dollars processed on the platform and that thing had a lot to do with how big and successful you would be, and therefore how well you would retain.\n\nAdam Fishman: And so we looked at very early signals to understand and evaluate how good someone was going to be. We also did a lot of qualitative screening in the beginning. So as people went through, we would take samplings of creators who were onboarding and signing up and launching their pages, and we would actually look at who the creator was and what they were doing. And then we would be able to run it through our model to say, \"It looks like we're getting a lot of the right people going through and doing the right behaviors, therefore, we're very confident that they're going to retain better and do the right things.\" So yeah, proxy metrics are the key there.\n\nLenny: Awesome. So part of this is find this leading indicator proxy metric, and then to your point, maybe build a little bit of a heuristic that's like, okay, this is qualitatively looking like it's doing the right things to our new users.",

    "text": "Adam Fishman: Yep.\n\nLenny: Maybe our last question on onboarding is, at Airbnb and I imagine many companies, there's this constant desire to, \"Let's just redo this whole thing. Let's just redesign it. Let's start again.\" And my question to you is just, how much is too much on redoing, rethinking, onboarding, optimizing, micro-optimizing? Any answers there?\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah. I would say first, I very strongly dislike the idea of redesigning something for redesigning sake. So I think that it is true that you should spend a lot of time on onboarding, and you should regularly revisit it as you learn new things about your users. So even at Patreon, we would work on onboarding and then we take a beat, we'd let it go for a while, improved, and then as we learn new things, we would find ways to fold those back into onboarding. So I find that it's acceptable to revisit when you are learning net new principles about your customers or something new about your growth model where onboarding can directly influence.\n\nAdam Fishman: So as we learned at Patreon what the right tier construction was, or the right way to talk about your Patreon page or the right way to message it in the beginning, we would go back and say, \"How do we build this newfound knowledge into an experience that sets someone up for success?\" But if we weren't gaining new insights, we weren't just tweaking the onboarding experience and trying to tune it in a very micro way, because the reality is, that doesn't really move the needle that often, especially once you've got it in a pretty good foundational place. And only when you discover something really fundamentally net new, will it have an outsized impact on retention or the success of early users. So don't just redesign for redesign sake, make sure there's a new hard earned insight that you've got before you do it.",

And I guess, do you think that makes sense?\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah. I think it's very helpful. And the reason I think it's helpful is because I do think it's easy to walk away from onboarding because there's so many other things to work on and to lose sight of the fact this is such a critical part of the experience. And I don't know how many times I've come into a company and they're like, \"Yeah, we built that a long time ago and we've never looked at it again. It's been a few years, but we're really having a real problem with retention and people dropping off in the first seven days.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, I think it's time we take another look at the onboarding experience. Products change quite a bit. Maybe people are getting something that's different than they expect, or maybe we know a lot more that we can use to influence decisions that they make.\"\n\nAdam Fishman: So I do think it is beneficial to have that team, or at least a team, that part of their job is the activation experience and therefore some part of their roadmap is working on onboarding and then other aspects of activation. So it may not be what they work on 12 months out of the year, but maybe for a quarter or two in a given year.\n\nLenny: Cool.

And you have this really cool framework that I think you call PMF for candidates. Can you talk about what that is and then we'll get into it a little bit?\n\nAdam Fishman: Yeah. I somehow stumbled on that name and it just made sense because of the acronym. But I think I was really motivated to revisit this because as we know in tech there's been a ton of layoffs and very public layoffs because of the economy, the state of funding, things like that. And I don't think we're done yet. I think we're pretty far from being done. But it's really important, and I've been burned by this a few times, to put some power back in the hands of the people who are actually seeking the jobs to understand what are some criteria that are important and these are the criteria that are important to me that help you make decisions about which company I should join, assuming they'll have me. And so the PMF acronym, and we're all familiar with product-market fit, right?\n\nAdam Fishman: So in a way it's both the product-market fit for as a candidate with the company, but then also PMF stands for people, mission and financials. And these are my three criteria. They may not be yours, Lenny, or they might not be the average person on the street, but the point is that you should have a set of criteria that you are unapologetically rigorous around and you should learn how to evaluate companies against that set of criteria.

What do I think about my peer set, the leaders, the people below me, if that's the role I'm stepping into, et cetera. So that's the people dimension.\n\nAdam Fishman: Mission, which is critically important for me, is that if I join a company and I do my job, which often involves growing that company really big, getting a lot of customers, generating a lot of demand and retention and stuff, I want to make sure that a lot of people have a better outcome in life because of that company's existence. And I don't just mean employees and founders having a good financial outcome, which I think is important. But I also mean in the case of creators on Patreon, we were building a new way for creators to make money, which they could then use to hire people, create more jobs, make better content, and live their life in a sustainable way so that they weren't a starving artist and they weren't living paycheck to paycheck. So that's really important, the mission aspect, that's got to exist.\n\nAdam Fishman: And then the third one is, and I think really important now is this idea of financials or fiscal discipline. You've got a lot of companies who raised boatloads of money or did financial planning during the peak of the pandemic and assumed that their business was going to continue operating at the pace that it was operating forever. A lot of those companies are running out of money, they've seen a hit to demand and they've had to lay people off as a result or make really big strategic swings.\n\nAdam Fishman: There are plenty of companies that you're not really hearing about that were more conservative in their approach, that understood and were able to look into the future and be really responsible with their money. And those people are not laying off employees. And so they're not all over LinkedIn talking about it because they're not laying people off. There's no hashtag layoff for them. So that's what by financials. And so that's the PMF framework and evaluating across those dimensions is super important. I've done it two times in the last 10 to 15 years, and I've done it poorly, two times in the last 15 years. And Lyft and Patreon are two times where I've done it really well. Wyzant and Imperfect Foods are two times where I personally don't think I've done a good enough job evaluating.",

I already talked about the Wyzant example where we had to lay off a bunch of people because the founders expected something very different than what I expected to be able to deliver, that's a big people miss. And Imperfect Foods was somewhat similar, amazing mission, really great financial strategy, fantastic CFO, but a lot of infighting at the C-suite. And it made it really difficult for us to plan and move the company forward together because people were at odds with each other all the time and not resolving disagreements productively. And when that happens, it's hard to be a product or a growth leader because you bear the brunt of the angst that people have. So anyway, so those are a couple examples and some of the characteristics of PMF.\n\nLenny: In the case of Imperfect Foods, what could you have done to have avoided that issue and seen if it was true PMF?\n\nAdam Fishman: I would have tried to observe the inner workings of the C-Suite a little bit more closely before I accepted an offer to join the company. I would've attended an executive meeting or joined them on an offsite. And I think, too often, candidates don't feel like they can ask for those things. And it's true, if you're entering the C-suite, you're going to ask for more stuff, you're more experienced. But I also think that's true of a junior employee. You can observe a team meeting, you can observe a product review and understand, you sign an NDA, you promise you won't tell anybody about it, but observe what is happening and the dynamics of that room. Who's doing the talking? How feedback is delivered, is it constructive? Is it antagonistic, et cetera. So you can observe and then you can also ask questions.\n\nAdam Fishman: So questions that I like to ask are, tell me about the last strategic offsite that you had as a leadership team. Where do people disagree? What was one thing that they disagreed on and where did you end up on that point and how did you get there? And I actually ask them to tell me, it's like a reverse behavioral interview question. I ask them to tell me how they navigated it, and I will ask the CEO that and really dig in on that particular set of questions. Those are the things that I do to evaluate the people dimension, which is one of the hardest, I will say. Financials and mission a little easier to evaluate, but people really require getting to know teams. So it is hard.",

    "text": "Lenny: That's such a good question to ask. And your point is you can ask that even if you're not a senior leader, you're just ICPM joining a team. Is there anything else you think folks can do? So you said, join some offsites maybe, ask this question that you shared, any other tips for folks just to understand if the people are a good fit? Because it's pretty wild. You're going to spend so much time with these people and you meet them once in a half hour interview and then you have to decide if that's your life for the next four or five, 10 years.\n\nAdam Fishman: Well, one thing that I would say is, you're an investor, right? You invest in a lot of companies, you're an angel investor and you have the Airbnb syndicate and things like that. You evaluate companies when you're making an investment decision, right? Because you're investing a sum of money into that company. And so as a result, you do a lot of diligence on companies or read other people's diligence, something like that. When you're interviewing at a company, you are actually investing an even more scarce resource. You're investing your time. There is no way to get more time. We're all on a finite clock. You can always get more money. If you make a bad investment decision, \"Okay, we lost there.\" Provided you didn't bankrupt yourself. Even if you did, you can climb out of bankruptcy. There are things that you can do, but time is fleeting.\n\nAdam Fishman: And so one of the other things, and this is a thing that you do when you're an investor, is you do back channel references, right? A company is going to back channel, you the employee, if they're a good company, they're going to talk, if you and I had worked together, Lenny, they might say, \"Hey, let me get in touch with Lenny and see what it was really like working with Adam instead of what Adam tells me in the interview process.\" And you're going to do this as an investor in a company. \"Let me talk to some people who passed on investing in this company. What did they see that I don't see?\"\n\nAdam Fishman: And so in this case, you can talk to current or former employees who are not on the interview circuit. And because they are not on the interview circuit, their role as a salesperson in the process is greatly diminished. And they can, especially if they're not at the company anymore, give you some pretty candid feedback on what it's like to work there. So I'll give you a really good example. That was super impressive. A PM who worked for me at Patreon, who you know Tal Raviv-",

If they're trying to withhold that from you. Because why would you?

I'm confident that those were the right decisions and that those people ended up in a better place and they were taken care of with great care. I would actually make a reference of somebody who I have let go before just so that someone could get a real honest truth of what it was like working with me. So anyways, that's my take on PMF and questions to ask.\n\nLenny: I imagine you have PMF with your current world, so maybe just to close, can you just remind folks what you're up to now and where they can find you online and also how listeners can be useful to you?\n\nAdam Fishman: First, thanks for having me on, Lenny.

Advisory work is what pays the bills right now, and my kids need to eat. I probably need to eat a little less, but my kids need to eat. So reach out about an advisory relationship if you're looking for some help on growth or product or general company building. It's what I do.\n\nLenny: Adam, you're so full of insights and lessons, and I'm so happy that you've started writing and sharing a lot of these things. Folks should definitely subscribe.

    "text": "Adam Grenier: One of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, \"How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?\" I was like, \"Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market.\" It's a different market now, so you have to start over. And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things, and you could be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for.\n\nLenny: Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Adam Grenier. Adam was head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber where he basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team from the ground up. Then he went on to VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School, and most recently he was VP of Marketing at Masterclass. These days, Adam advises companies, large and small, on growth and marketing strategy.\n\nLenny: In our conversation, we cover how to decide when to try new and emerging acquisition channels like TikTok, VR, newsletter ads, and how to go about testing them out. We get into the growth CMO role, which is an emerging role that Adam has helped pioneer, and we get into some real talk about burnout and depression and mental health issues that often come with working in tech. This was a really powerful and insightful conversation and I learned a lot from Adam both as an operator and as a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. And so with that, I bring you Adam Grenier.\n\nLenny: This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I ask product managers and designers on Twitter what software they use most, Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking combining visual, text and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, white boarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs, and that includes thousands of built-in icons and a rich library of templates.

I think pre-Uber, the first chunk of my career was on the advertising side, so worked in agency world. So, I kind of think of this as phase three of my life.

I lived in Chicago, did Second City ImprovOlympic, a variety of different places, did quite a bit of performing, but also got into corporate paychecks early as well.\n\nAdam Grenier: And so kind of built a lifestyle that made doing improv full time probably not the best path for me at the time. And so made a pretty conscious choice early on that it was more of a hobby and if something ever came of it, cool, but if not, that's okay. It's something I keep coming back to, because it's very grounding and fulfilling in ways that work and family life and things like that don't quite hit for me.\n\nLenny: Actually at Airbnb we had an improv teacher come and work with the PM team.

And I'm curious what you've taken away from improv that has helped you become better at your work?\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I think generally the whole suite of skills that you develop in improv are pretty applicable, right? Because you are getting comfortable on your feet with change, with teamwork, building off of each other, experimenting, trying new things, a little bit of everything. I think a couple of the key rules or themes of improv that I really try to hammer home with people are obviously the \"Yes, and...\" side of improv, which everyone's probably heard, which is in a scene the worst thing you could do is deny somebody, because you're actually just stopping progress and you're not building off of anything.\n\nAdam Grenier: So, the appropriate approach is to say, \"Yes, that is true, and...\" and add to it. So, if someone's like, \"Hey, you have a chicken on your head,\" not saying, \"No, I don't.\" Just kind of ruins that scene. Versus saying, \"Yes, I do, and it's name is Sally. What's your chicken's name?\" Builds on that and gives it more opportunity. And so I think that in growth in business is super important to be able to say, \"Yes, I do see your idea,\" or \"Yes, we did accomplish this and this is what we want to do next and this is how it's going to build on it,\" I think is super important.",

    "text": "Adam Grenier: The other one that I think is less known or talked about is the gift of details. So, in a scene, if you give somebody really specific details about something, it gives so much more meat to be able to work off of in terms of what's coming next. So, if someone's starting a scene and they're clearly watching television and clicking through the channels and I walk up and just say like, \"Oh, you're watching TV, cool.\" That's a yes statement. I'm not denying what they did. But if I come up and say like, \"Oh cool, you're watching TV. Is that an Alf episode? I haven't seen Alf since I was a kid. It reminds me this one time I actually ate my own cat.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: Just giving those specific details of Alf and me as a kid and I had a cat, which if people don't know Alf, he ate cats.\n\nLenny: I don't remember that. I remember Alf, but I don't remember he ate cats.\n\nAdam Grenier: He was always trying to get the family cat. So, those kinds of details add a ton of value and you take that into the business world, to use Masterclass for instance, if I say, \"Yeah, Masterclass, we've got this way to build content that is both entertainment and education,\" that's interesting. But if I say, \"We create content that is both education and entertainment to solve people's deep curiosities in the way that maybe a biography would.\" That just opens up the exact problem that you're trying to solve. What are other alternatives to that problem? How are people consuming that?

Have you found it also to be helpful in collaboration like this \"Yes, and...\" piece? I'm curious, is there an example or story where you like \"Yes, and...\" someone? Do you actually say \"Yes, and...\" in a meeting? How do you actually find that you use it?\n\nAdam Grenier: I hear it every now and then. I don't usually literally say it. I think one of the areas that I've found it to be valuable is when you've got cross-functional work. So, obviously at Uber we dealt with city teams a lot, and so a lot of the times the way that the central team would scope a problem versus a local team would scope a problem, would almost feel at odds with each other. And if you approach it with that \"Yes, and...\", it's often still true.\n\nAdam Grenier: It's like, oh, both of these things can be true at once. You could have a different goal than I have, or you have a system problem local to you that is important to you and it's not important to me. That's okay, both things can exist. So, now that we accept both and can work off of each other, we're more likely to build both a better rapport and energy among ourselves because we're not just saying, \"No, no, no, no, you're wrong. That's not true, that's not important to the business. Why are you doing that?\" That type of energy when cross-functional work, it just kills the scene, it kills that progress. And then you don't build relationships, you don't build the right solutions, all that type of stuff.\n\nLenny: It sounds really good. Everyone in theory wants to be really good at this. And I imagine just doing a bunch of improv is a really good way to get better at not getting defensive and being like, \"Yes. And how do we make this idea better?\" Is there something you can advise folks to work on this skill, or is it just do a bunch of improv classes and it'll kind of help build that skill?",

    "text": "Adam Grenier: That's one. I would say that I'll say that all the time to people, \"Do some improv classes.\" And I get a lot of people like, \"No, I'm not funny,\" or, \"I don't want to do improv.\" And I think it's still a really great class to take, even if you have zero interest in doing improv, or public speaking, or any of that kind of stuff. Because, again, improv 101 is taught everywhere. Every city has it somewhere, and it's rarely ever people that are trying to do improv professionally. It's all games, like you said. The classes that you all did at Airbnb is what improv 101 is, right?\n\nAdam Grenier: It's just like, \"Hey, let's just have fun. Let's just get out of our skin,\" and things like that. So, I do think everybody should take improv classes. I think it's also something with a lot of goals or skills that you want to develop, I think being really public and open about you wanting to develop that. So, if you are managing a team and you want to sharpen the skills, make it a team goal, or have accountability and just say, \"Hey guys, I know that I've been pushing back on things lately. I want to really try to embrace and grow off of ideas better, hold me accountable, call me out and be like, 'Adam, \"Yes, and...\" this please.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: Or giving people permission to push back on that when it doesn't happen, I think also just opens the door for more productive conversations with people and the ability to hold yourself accountable and keep trying it.\n\nLenny: I love that. And such a good team bonding activity. There's like all these reasons to do this as a team. My wife actually, she's a designer, artist, writer, illustrator kind of person, and she's been taking a lot of these sorts of classes to help inspire her creativity.

    "text": "Adam Grenier: Yeah.\n\nLenny: Okay, great. So, to start with in the first topic, if you think about it just every company essentially goes through this kind of S-curve of growth. They start slow, they find something that's working, then hopefully it works out and things start to grow, grow, grow, and then eventually it flattens out and you see this S-curve that happens. And every company is always trying to find the next S-curve to add this layer on the cake that keeps overall growth up while this first growth channel slows.\n\nLenny: And so people are always looking for what's the next thing? \"Oh man, Clubhouse is coming out. We should get on Clubhouse.\" \"Oh, TikTok is so hot, we've got to run some TikTok ads.\" And there's always something new, like newsletter ads, I don't know, podcast ads, if that's new. And you have a really interesting framework for how to think about this and make decisions and experiment. So, I'd love to hear insights there.\n\nAdam Grenier: So, the exploring emerging channels framework that I'll take, either my teams or companies that I'm advising through, has three core ingredients that I like to spend time with. So, the first is really understanding if there is an overlap between what the customers need is, what your company's goals are, and what the channel actually does really well. So, the example I've used in the past is Spotify in the moment of things like Clubhouse and Paparazzi and stuff like that becoming really popular.",

    "text": "Adam Grenier: Well, for Spotify, they're trying to get more people to consume music and be entertained by music and things like that. And it's all audio driven. And so their growth goals are probably around new customers or deeper engagement with audio. The customer's needs are discovery and more ways to maybe have deeper relationships with their music. If you're a jazz fan, can you learn new jazz artists or more about the artists that you love? Things like that. And then take those two channels. If you take something like Clubhouse, it's audio first, it's almost like live podcast radio type feel to it.\n\nAdam Grenier: You can get into these rooms with just people with really amazing esoteric knowledge about something. And so its strengths have a really clean overlap to me with the goals of Spotify, the needs of the customer and the strengths of that. And so that to me is great. That is probably a green light in terms of is it even worth our time? Versus Paparazzi is very photo driven and nothing really to do with music or anything like that. And so it's like even though Paparazzi might have become the best biggest channel ever, is that the thing you should be putting your time into? It would be a yellow light for me at best.\n\nLenny: And how did you describe that again? It's the medium matches?\n\nAdam Grenier: Yeah, the strengths of the medium. So, let's take influencer right now. Actually two of the channels that a lot of people are talking about right now are streaming TV or OTT and influencer marketing. And so to me, one of the strengths of influencer marketing is hyper targeted contextual marketing. And so I can go find the five influencers that are hardcore Alf fans, and if I'm marketing Alf something, great, I can go find that specific thing. Whereas OTTs a lot harder to get that specific.",

    "text": "Lenny: Got it. Okay, cool. So, the first is the strength of the channel. You should look at that.\n\nAdam Grenier: Yep. And how that overlaps with your customer and your business needs. The second is the channel DNA. And so this is looking at things like where are they in their trajectory? So, Clubhouse is actually a perfect example, because in a weird way, so Clubhouse got hot before Facebook got cold. And I was pretty amazed how many more people were trying to crack Clubhouse than TikTok, because TikTok hadn't really released their ads solution yet, but neither had Clubhouse. But everybody was talking about Clubhouse, and TikTok is very clearly not going away anytime soon, where Clubhouse hopefully won't. Like this is an amazing product.\n\nAdam Grenier: I really enjoyed it and loved it, but it was clearly very early, very quickly at that point of hotness where everyone was just kind of, \"That's the reason I should be there.\" And part of this reason is to accept the risks of going into that channel. So, if I go and dedicate two quarters of work to Clubhouse, I need to accept that they are so early in this curve that there's a good chance this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it'll be over. It's not a repeatable action. It also is important because if you get something to work on a channel that's earlier in their growth curve, the likelihood that they will change is very high.\n\nAdam Grenier: You're going to need to commit a lot of cycles to keep it going, because it's like, \"Okay, well, their product is going to evolve drastically very quickly over the next two years.\" And so a really great example is Facebook early... I was at Zoosk. And so Zoozk and companies like Zynga got tons of their early growth because of notifications on Facebook, which was one of their early features, which allowed basically anybody that took any action on Zynga, it would post on everybody else's page that you got 10 carrots, and that was a huge growth lever.",

    "text": "Adam Grenier: But then Facebook just pulled the plug on that. And so it's like, well, if you put all of your energy into that and that's it, it was pretty clear that that was still an area that's like this may not last forever. The last thing on the channel DNA that I like to look at that's a little bit more, I don't know if odd or unusual is the right term, is I like to spend a lot of time thinking about how they monetize. What is the monetization strategy of the channel? And the reason is because if you, as a business, can match or support their monetization strategy, it actually gives you a really interesting leg up with that channel.\n\nAdam Grenier: Because the likelihood of you being able to call them up and go do custom stuff with them, or partner with them, or that your solutions will actually stick around for a while, it'd go up pretty drastically. And so my key example of this was with when Facebook started exploring mobile ads, Hotel Tonight, we were one of the alpha testers of mobile ads, because I'd been sitting here buying ad inventory on networks for the last five or six years and just waiting for Facebook to work, because it just wasn't really working for mobile installs.\n\nAdam Grenier: And it's like, I know this is a huge channel because I can use it on my online marketing, my web marketing, but as a mobile acquisition it's nowhere near as efficient as a lot of these other networks. And so as soon as they were doing that, I was able to basically position and say, \"Look it, you want to work with us. Let me into your alpha, because I have five years of experience already buying mobile ads. I know the space. I know it'll work. And if you get us to work, we're a killer case study, because we are a non-game and a lot of money is spent on gaming, but there's these whole other major categories that you're going to need other than gaming examples within that group. So, you're going to be able to use me as a case study and a lot of different scenarios than the gaming players.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: And so I was spending a lot less than the gaming players, but because of that understanding that your goal at Facebook is to make ads work for all of travel and for all of leisure and those kinds of things, that's the value of working with me. So, that's another piece of the channel DNA I like people to focus on.",

That's such a good one, because to your point, if your goals are aligned, they're going to be like, \"Yes, let's make this happen.\" And it always feels like it's this behemoth that doesn't want to talk to any new startups, but if you can make the case of this is going to help you and the way you laid out is so clear, it's such a good idea.\n\nAdam Grenier: And especially with emerging channels, right? Because their whole thing is that make this work for a long time. It's part of the challenge you see with some new channels flipping to the other side of growing an ads business, will gravitate towards like, \"I want to get Disney on here,\" but Disney is very campaign driven, or they have been traditionally, where it's like you may get one big paycheck from them, but that doesn't... The way that UA driven gaming works is you get that to work, that's a gift that keeps on giving forever, right? Because there's not one of those companies, there's thousands of them and they all do the same thing. So, being able to drive that conversation is really helpful.\n\nLenny: Cool.\n\nAdam Grenier: And then the third main ingredient is just your own company DNA. And so I think risk profile is a big one. Do you actually have comfort in being a first mover, a true first mover? Nobody knows anything, tracking's not going to work, it's not going to be programmatic. You're probably going to show up on content that's offensive. You're probably going to ask for refunds that won't happen. It's going to be really painful to be a true first mover. Do you have that appetite? Do you have the staff to actually be able to put someone on that and it not distract from everything else?",

There's very few companies that I recommend saying, \"Yes, go put energy on this brand new channel that you don't know how to scale yet before you've figured out some type of volume on Google and Facebook.\" Every now and then there may be a perfect fit where it's like, absolutely, you should be the person doing this. But if you're not at least getting something out of the basic channels that everybody else is using, it's probably not the thing you should be putting your first energy into. It should be like, \"Great, I've got a good foundation.\" Like you said, now we're at that stage of trying to add things, tends to be a better stage to do more risky exploration into new channels.\n\nLenny: What advice do you have or can you give to founders teams that are trying to test one of these in terms of just how to run these tests? How much time should they spend, would you say? What do they look for? I know that this is a hard question and super dependent on the situation, but any advice there?\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I think going through those three ingredients should help shape that answer, right? Because if you're like, \"Okay, well, the first one is super strong, the channel DNA is maybe really early and I've got a small to mid-size team and maybe only one channel working,\" then it may be like, \"Great. Put half of one person into this, because it's maybe interesting. But don't put any more than that into it.\" Versus if it's like, \"Man, this is a killer fit the channel's a little further along and I have a 20 person team, so I'm going to put three dedicated people to this, because we are in prime position to be the leaders in this new channel and really push it.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I think it's figuring those pieces out, because it is a very it depends answer, but rarely ever is it like, \"Hey, this should be your entire team's focus for the next three sprints or five sprints.\" I think that if you've got that half person working on it for a while and there starts to be some magic happening, sure, put a sprint or two against it as a whole team.

I don't know, what's the range of just maybe don't spend more than X months on something new if it's not clearly working, just based on your experience.\n\nAdam Grenier: Generally I wouldn't let anything bleed past a quarter. You can probably get some good signal in a month or less, what I would call fishing. It wouldn't be like you're just putting bait in the water to figure out where the fish are, not necessarily getting statistically significant repeatable solutions. The big variables that can change that timing, so if I'm exploring a new video channel, the content I need to create is if I'm going to have to create something that takes three weeks to produce and $20,000 to make, I may want to give it a little more time, because I gave it more of an upfront investment.\n\nAdam Grenier: Versus if it's like I want to put text ads in podcasts listings or something like that. It's like, great, I can do that by myself at midnight and it's not distracting anybody or anything. And if it doesn't work in three weeks, let's move on. But generally ideally what you're working through, and we'll touch a little bit more on this with the Growth CMO, is that this should all be part of a roadmap. It shouldn't just be randomly chosen and thrown at. This should be part of your sprint process and you should have a backlog of other things that you want to try. And so you're actually weighing that decision of how long based on what other opportunities you're missing out on by investing in that.\n\nAdam Grenier: But I would say most channels, especially new ones, are going to take more than a couple cycles to kind of suss out. Because there's no rules, there's no playbooks yet on how to do them well. So, give it a little bit of time, but if you're going over a quarter and you don't feel like directionally it's getting better or it's interesting, I would put it back on ice for a while.",

So, something like Clubhouse I'm probably not going to see clicks. It's more about are we able to start a room and increase the size of that room by 10% every time that we run it? Okay great, that means that we're at least getting better at this and there's more reach available to us. But if we're getting 20 people every time we start a room and then it goes down to 15, then we're either not doing this well, the channel's not doing well, or there's just not enough reach for us to actually expand. Versus TikTok you might be able to say, \"Great, I can actually track clicks and conversion, so let's look at it the way we would any other channel.\"\n\nLenny: Got it.

    "text": "Lenny: Cool. So, a question that I'm sure is on many people's minds that they would want to ask is, Adam, what are emerging platforms that are interesting right now that we should experiment with? What do you feel?\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I mean I mentioned OTT, or basically the key thing with OTT is that it's way more trackable than traditional television, but it has similar value that traditional TV does in terms of the ability to do more long form storytelling type content, and a lot of it's not skippable if you buy it. And so those are reasons to be exploring that right now. It's hard for me to call that emerging channel, because it's been around forever. It's there's more of it and the tools and services around it are way better now than they were four years ago. And so I think the sophistication and ability to scale OTT is much higher now than ever before. Influencers probably the one that I'm most intrigued by, because similar to OTT, the scale and services and the ability to go do it is still there.\n\nAdam Grenier: It's also got that hyper granularity that when I get into influencer tools, it feels to me like early Facebook when I used to go be able to target Lenny, or 10 people that have exactly the same likes as Lenny. And that type of stuff where it's like you can get so specific and find exactly who you need. It's incredibly tedious and manual and it's a lot of relationship management. So, I'm also keeping an eye on the technology being built around influencer, because I think that's a huge area of opportunity for entrepreneurs right now.\n\nAdam Grenier: But generally speaking, the scope and opportunity there is huge and it's not going away, but it feels very new and different right now. And it supplements the ability to do some hyper level targeting that you've not been able to do, that Facebook and Google are getting less open about at the same time. I think VR is really interesting in the way that mobile was interesting before iPhone Three, where it was if you've got a VR app, it's a really interesting space, but if you don't, it's not that interesting to me yet. Any that have come up for you that you're like... what are your thoughts on this?",

There's still a ton to do there and influencers is also weird, because it crosses all of these other worlds as well. But I think TikTok is actually hyper interesting and everyone should be doing that. But I think of that less as you should be doing it as should I do it, should I not? And it's more I need to figure out how to do Facebook if I'm at least mildly appropriately should be there.\n\nAdam Grenier: The podcast ads I think are great. I think that I bought podcast ads 15 years ago, so it doesn't feel like an emerging channel to me. I think there's way more volume now than there's ever been before. One of the guys that was on my team at Uber has a company that's doing programmatic buying and that type of stuff. And so I think there's more opportunities on podcast. I think people want to treat it like Facebook ads or direct response ads, immediate response ads. And actually what I keep seeing as the effective strategy with podcast ads is treating them more like radio where it's more about getting on the right program, making it personal and feel like it should be part of that program, and then repeating over and over and over again.\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I think podcast is super interesting.

    "text": "Lenny: Yep. That's exactly who I work with usually. One last question on this topic. What percentage of the time do you find that an emerging channel works? Is it like 20% of the time, 10%, 5%? What should people estimate, it's probably not going to work but when it does it's going to be game changing?\n\nAdam Grenier: Like 5% of the time. There's new things popping up all the time. I think the area that I think of as emerging that I've found more success in is taking things that exist already and make them... so the two slices of it are either it's existed for a long... like podcasting. So, it existed for a long time and now we're finally getting to a spot where it feels scalable. The other is existing channels that introduce something brand new.\n\nAdam Grenier: So, at the mobile ads I described on Facebook, pre mobile install ads and post. Those first 18 months of mobile install felt like an emerging channel, right? Because they were changing the product every week and tracking didn't work, and there were all these funky problems with it even though Facebook had been around forever. But brand spanking new channels, I don't know, they rarely work or are worth the effort early that you hope that they will be.\n\nLenny: Cool. But when they work, it's game changing I imagine. Reminds me Apples coming out with Apple TV, I think it was, and they're just like, \"Hey Airbnb, you should make it app for Apple TV. It'll be huge.\" And there's a team put on it. I don't know. They spent a month building this app and did a bunch of nothing as far as I understand, but it felt good. It felt good to be part of the launch. One question I wanted to come back to, are there tools that you recommend for influencer marketing that you want to plug, or point out?",

    "text": "Lenny: Sweet. Okay. If any other comes to mind, we'll throw it in the show notes. Before we get to the growth CMO discussion, there's kind of this tangential area that I wanted to spend a little time on, which is this idea of as a startup you initially should and often do start with a very narrow audience, your early adopters. I read this post about calling them your super specific who, and eventually you want to cross the chasm and go broader. And you have some interesting insights on how to think about that, and when to do that. Can you talk about that?\n\nAdam Grenier: Yeah. So, I think the book, Crossing the Chasm, is a great place to start in terms of thinking about the broader topic of that. What I see missed a lot of the time that I like to spend time with people on is to really understand that those early adopters are often just drastically different than the broad audience. And spending time to actually figure that out and map out what you need to see with those early adopters to have confidence that the product is actually going to have product market fit beyond them.\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I don't have anything hyper specific to add to that necessarily, or happy to dig in deeper to it, but it's probably the biggest challenge that I've seen with a lot of companies that I've worked with. And then as I do more investing and things like that, it's probably the biggest flag that I see with a lot of companies that claim to have product market fit, which is your TAM and your product market fit are not using the same definition. And that problem I think is often just a red flag for a lot of companies that I meet.\n\nLenny: Got it. So, essentially you often underestimate how challenging it'll be to grow from your initial early adopter crowd. Is there an example of that happening where a company just got screwed because they didn't think about that enough? Or is there something someone can do early on? Is it test a little bit more broadly early? What do you recommend there?",

Even right now, one of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, \"How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?\" I was like, \"Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market. It's a different market now, so you have to start over.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things and you can be right back on track.

And in my mind, I think a Growth CMO is looking at each brand investment as how do you then immediately follow that up with the next one? How do you shift to this fast product iteration mindset with even things like brand?\n\nAdam Grenier: It's very possible, but it's so counter to a lot of traditional marketing DNA. That, to me, means that we have a lot of mismatch marketing leadership, and that quickly eliminates trust with the marketing organization. It means that we rename everything marketing to product led growth, or growth, or referral programs. To me, it actually dilutes the value of marketing should be playing in the company. And it doesn't mean that the traditional marketing CMO isn't a good fit for some companies.\n\nAdam Grenier: I think the direct to consumer products are still very well suited to have a more traditional CMO. But I think product driven companies, product led companies, if you are CMO and your product leader aren't married at the hip, you're just missing out on just tons of opportunity, and the likelihood of things actually working very well consistently and compounding on each other.\n\nLenny: So, what are the attributes of this person of what you call a Growth CMO? Sounds like partly it's being much more performance driven. Sounds like a big part of it is understanding product and not creating these silos. We're going to market the thing, you guys go build this thing. But also as a person, that's a great CMO. What else do you look for?",

    "text": "Adam Grenier: So, I would say so data driven generally. To me performance is a very loaded word in our world, because people think, especially in marketing, think that means not brand. But they're very data driven. And so when we take things like retention and even brand and the consideration funnel and, yes, you can't measure those exactly like you can measure landing page clicks and sales, but you absolutely can measure them. And making that part of the DNA of everything that's happening, data being part of that, I think is pretty quintessential of being a growth driven CMO.\n\nAdam Grenier: The second, I think, is the iteration process is not thinking about things and, \"Hey, we need to plan for the next 24 months,\" but you can still do that and you can still have a vision and everything. But having that more of a agile type approach to everything. And again, this could be the storytelling that your sales people are doing, to what are your landing pages look like, to what is the design of your logo, to the brand itself. All of those things, like being more open to everything being possibly iterated on, on a regular basis using data to validate that and challenge what has worked for you.\n\nAdam Grenier: We live in such a real time world now, especially with product driven companies. The things change so quickly. If you as a marketing leader aren't being iterative and thoughtful about things with it, you'll get eaten alive. And then I think experimentation is just a huge piece of it. And something that I see a lot of more traditional marketing leaders, the idea of experimentation is try a new channel. It's not like how do we experiment with our brand? How do we experiment with the funnel? The whole picture, not just the top of the funnel or the external elements of it.\n\nAdam Grenier: One of the things that I haven't quite figured out the right language to put against this, but the traditional model of marketing is the four P's, product, placement, promotion, pricing. And in my mind, the world that we live in now, product is no longer a part of marketing, but it's actually they're married at the hip. They're one and the same, and most companies aren't operating that way. They're still operating as if they're two wildly different things. Even if they say they're working together, it's still, there's not. And to me it's just like, no, no, the product, it is the company now.",

    "text": "Adam Grenier: And the marketing is integrated with literally every single piece of it. A lot of traditional marketing got established in the 1920s and the 1950s around products that took years to develop or try, or a product team was a science group trying new flavors of cereal. And so the marketing team owned the box, where it went on the shelf and what the price was and all of those kinds of things was marketing, because product was such a wildly different part of the organization. And I think still there's just a lot of fundamental things that marketers think about that are stuck in that world, because most haven't had to grow through the true growth of a business that's just being established today.\n\nLenny: And the assumption is every software company should be hiring a CMO that is of this sort, of a Growth CMO, right?\n\nAdam Grenier: Yeah. And I would say that my sense is that there's very few marketing leaders that can't be a Growth CMO. So, I don't think you have to have come up as a performance driven experimentation. It's more about adapting and growing. And again, the fundamentals are all the same. One of my pet projects that I haven't done anything with yet, is that every time something new comes out in the growth world, I go back in history as far as I can to try to find the earliest example of that. Just to be able to say, \"Look, this isn't new, but we can learn from the way that Coca-Cola invented the coupon.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: The first known coupon was Coca-Cola giving away Coke for free, but it was actually a marketplace, because what they would do is they would go to a town and they would go to the soda fountain and they would give a free Coke syrup to that side of the market and they would give coupons to the other side of the market to spark it, to get it going. And then it's like, well, now all the customers want Coke, now you need to supply it, you'll pay for it. And learning that and understanding that is really cool. And it's just interesting to me, because I'm a huge nerd.",

All of those things have stayed the same. It's the operating of it in the way a growth organization, like a product driven growth organization operates, is very fundamentally different than the way a traditional marketing run organization had run.\n\nLenny: I was going to ask you what a marketing leader can do to evolve into this where you think things are going, and your point about you're capable of it, you can iterate and adapt is really great and empowering. Is there anything specific they can do to learn how to do this better, other than is it like mentorship? Is there classes, courses? Just do the job, figure it out? Do you have anything you can suggest there to folks listening and they're like, \"Oh, shit. I'm in trouble?\"\n\nAdam Grenier: Honestly, I think learn product development. Go learn agile product development. And there's actually a book called Hacking Marketing, I think. I'll confirm. But it's essentially how to run a marketing team on Agile. That to me is just, again, any great marketing leader should be able to go and consume how to do product development, how to run a product like sprints and those types of things. And their mind, if they're great marketing CMO or a CMO, will be like, \"Oh my gosh, I could do this with this big event that we want to host. I could do this with everything.\"\n\nAdam Grenier: There's nothing off the table when you actually learn those fundamentals. But as well as I know smart people can learn that stuff. There's lots of resources out there. Reforge has some classes on it, there's a bunch of new product led growth classes out in the wild, like Maven I think has a couple. And there's a variety of those types of things that just going and doing it, you don't have to go and operate it yourself. You don't have to go become a product manager.

    "text": "Lenny: Awesome. I'm actually hearing from folks listening to this podcast not live right now, but broadly, that this is a good way to learn how product works and how product leaders think. So, that's interesting. So, if you're listening to this, good job. You also mentioned that a lot of marketing leaders don't work out at a company, they join, they leave, things go wrong. As a hiring founder or leader, what do you look for to tell you this person's probably not what we need and not what you'd call a Growth CMO? What are flags that are like they're probably not going to adapt and evolve to the way we want to operate?\n\nAdam Grenier: So, I think first and foremost, it obviously depends on the stage. Anything let's say C or below, comfortable with chaos and willingness to go do something they have not done for probably 15 years are two huge signals for me, because every company I've been part of at every scale now, which is all of them basically, that's the thing that a lot of people coming from more traditional marketing environments into startup worlds, it's a pace and just the unpredictability and change and those kinds of things are just at such a higher rate than they've seen for a long time that it can be really jarring for people.\n\nAdam Grenier: And I think it's totally reasonable. It's crazy, right? If anybody that's had the exposure on both sides. And then the willingness to go do the work. People are churning constantly and the challenges are different every week and those types of things. And so it's like every now and then you've got to go write an email or you've got to go open up Facebook and get into the weeds with it with your team, into the data of it and that type of stuff. And that's stuff that I don't want to do, personally, me. I'm past the point where I should be in Facebook.\n\nAdam Grenier: But man, when I need to, I'm willing to, and I'll go get in the weeds with it and I'll use my time to just be like, \"Look, we have to figure this out now.\" And I'm going to go do the things that I thought I was done with in my career. So, those are pretty big ones.

    "text": "Adam Grenier: Everybody came from something they probably became awesome at and then over time just expanded their purview. So, for me it was mobile. I got into mobile. My first client ever was on Sun Microsystems early 2000s, getting Java developers to make apps for flip phones. So, I just knew digital mobile world really, really well before a lot of people did. But then eventually I'm like, \"Great, now I'm running an entire digital marketing team. Now I'm running an entire marketing team. Now I'm getting into growth. Now I want to learn product,\" and I've expanded. And so typically it's going through that exercise of find out their T, find out their strength, and then spend time figuring out how they make up for those other things.\n\nAdam Grenier: So, for me, at Lambda school I ran our PR team for a while. I am not a PR person, but I make it a goal in my life to get to the valley of despair of the Dunning-Kruger effect, to be like, \"Great, I just need to know how bad I am at PR,\" because if I still think I'm good at it, that's not a good place for me to be. But once I know how bad it is, I now know I need to go hire the right person to come in and I'm going to listen to them. I'm not going to assume that I'm smarter than them, and those types of things. And so I think the same thing with product questions and data questions and experimentation questions for this concept of a Growth CMO is like, well, somebody's coming from a world where they've not had to work really closely with the product team, spend time with them to figure out how they plan on adapting to that.\n\nAdam Grenier: My guess is most won't have thought of that. The good ones will be able to figure it out together with you in that interview, or afterwards, or whatever it might be.\n\nLenny: Awesome. Maybe one day we'll do a follow-up chat just to dive into hiring a marketing person. I know that's a whole deep topic.",

So, I found this old tweet of yours where you talk about burnout and depression, and you kind of make this point that a lot of times you feel like it's burnout and it's actually depression. And just broadly mental health is just this topic that's not really spoken a lot about in tech and in business. And so I'd love to just spend a little time on this. I know you're a big proponent of talking about these sorts of things, so I'm curious, I know you've been through both these things and I'm curious just to hear your journey, what that's been like, and what you've learned about how to get through it?\n\nAdam Grenier: So, the two biggest inputs for me in terms of really taking the time to understand my mental health, one is my wife, who's been a very strong proponent of mental health resources for everybody since I met her. And so just being able to learn from her and get exposure to, well, why is this important? What are the values of it? And seeing it pretty regularly of family members, or coworkers. Or it's like, oh man, I bet there's something deeper here that maybe is important for them to figure out.\n\nLenny: Is that just something she's good at, or is she trained in this stuff?",

And so she just feels like poor people so much that I think it's something really important to her. And then at Uber, I got to a spot where I was incredibly exhausted and tired and just down, not excited about work and things like that, and so I started going to therapy and with this assumption that I was just working too hard.\n\nAdam Grenier: That was kind of my like, \"Man, I need to go to therapy to figure out the tools that I need to deal with me working too hard.\" And I just uncovered so many interesting things that I wouldn't have expected. So, one was that I'm the youngest child in my family and I did something pretty different than a lot of my relatives and things like that. So, recognition is something I long for, and it turns out I get that at work and I just hadn't gotten that in other parts of my life. And so this thing that I'm like, \"This is my problem,\" was actually a solution to my real problem.\n\nAdam Grenier: And knowing that just helped me totally just change my perspective of how hard I work. I was getting judgemental about myself around, \"Man, I'm working too hard. I shouldn't be doing this, but I have to.\" And then I got in the spot where I'm like, \"Oh, I'm working hard because I love it, because I like it, I'm having an impact and I'm working with people I like and people respect the work that I do.\" And that helped me identify that I can work just as hard, but I can work smarter. I can work more on the things I have impact on.\n\nAdam Grenier: I can work more with people that actually respected the type of work that I'm doing. And that actually just started to relax me and get me to the spot of, \"Oh, okay,\" I still some burnout in there, and that's part of the innovation. Part of my title was that I got to a spot where I'm like, I was traveling constantly, I had teams all over the world and the structure of Uber was working where every city had a GM and I was the person they called when their spend was too high.

    "text": "Adam Grenier: For me, it's hard to describe, but I personally now can pretty cleanly tell the difference between exhaustion and depression. And it tends to tie to my broader motivations, not just my motivation to work. So, when I'm exhausted, I'll still show up to work, I'll still execute, I'll still do those types of things, but I'm going to go and if I can take an improv class, it's going to be a blast. I'm going to enjoy it and I'm going to love it. If I'm depressed, I won't go to that improv class. I'll just cancel it. I won't go to it. Or if I go to it, I'll go home immediately. One of the things I love about actual improv classes, is the community. Is, \"Hey, let's all go grab a drink now.\" And this is a totally different group of people. It's not my family, it's not my work people, it's just me.\n\nAdam Grenier: And I wouldn't do that. And so it's kind of noticing where else is this impacting and to what degree and why, can help me understand what's going on in my life. Because more often than not, I can then take those feelings and it'll be like, \"Oh, I've felt this way for three weeks now. I should think about this and dissect it a little bit.\" And so again, I'll spend time with my therapist. One of the tools that my therapist has given me is to open up with my friends and have these conversations with my friends. And so now I went from five, six years ago really just having my therapist or my wife to talk about this kind of stuff to, I don't know, I have five or six different friends that we're massively transparent with each other about this stuff, because the second I shared any of this with them, they shared it with me.\n\nAdam Grenier: And now we've become safe places to have those conversations where I can be like, \"Hey, there's this thing going on.\" My dad has ALS and so he's been really sick and I've got three kids and I've got jobs and work and money and the market crash. And there's so many different things. It's like, okay, let me actually figure out which one of these things is causing this energy right now. And having many years of therapy now and those resources can help me get to that solution to get to that answer so that I can figure out, okay, what do I need to do right now? Do I need to actually take time for myself and dig deeper into these personal things? Do I actually need to change something with the shape of my career? Those types of things.\n\nLenny: Awesome. And it sounds like the things that have been most helpful, and I'm curious what else you'd recommend to folks that are maybe feeling some of this. So, it sounds like therapy is really powerful, your partner and being open to your partner, finding a group of friends where you could be transparent about these sorts of things.

There was a meditation thing that was the first, it almost felt like Noom for me for meditation where it wasn't just-\n\nLenny: Waking Up, Sam Harris's-\n\nAdam Grenier: Yeah, Waking Up where it's like I'm actually learning about meditation, not just learning how to meditate. And that's how my brain likes to do things. I'm a lifetime learner, I love digging into things. I learned breathing techniques and things like that, but going through that program of Waking Up was the first time I actually really appreciated when and how and where to do it. I'm still not a everyday meditate person.\n\nAdam Grenier: I now use, I'm an investor, so I'm biased, but Aura, A-U-R-A, which is a marketplace app. It's some of the other meditation apps, but it's a marketplace, so it's actually coaches and stuff adding content. So, I use that now as needed, which I really enjoy. The exercise and diet and those types of things definitely tie to it. It's like eating is a pretty clean signal for me, or snacking is a really clean signal, at least for me of like, okay, I'm snacking more than I should be, and eating healthy can both help me identify that I'm in those spots, but also just make me feel better.",

Listen to Lenny's podcast?\n\nLenny: I hope that to be true. I don't know if that's anywhere near as powerful as these other things. One thing I'll mention is on the meditation front, there's this amazing book that kind of does exactly what you also describe where it teaches you why this works. It's called, it's kind of like a bad title, it's called Why Buddhism is True. And it's not trying to convince you to be a Buddhist, but it has a lot of incredible insights on why meditation is so powerful and how to think about it.

I don't know.\" What are signs that you're burnt out versus just working a lot and tired?\n\nAdam Grenier: The one that I see the most is adaptability goes down really fast. And this is more me noticing I've managed a lot of people and coached a lot of people, so when I see that from people that I'm working with, I usually immediately bring up, I'm like, \"Look, your openness to change in the business, or trying new things, or going back and trying things that maybe we tried before and didn't work has shifted from, 'Oh, here are the flags that we should be aware of, but let's give it a shot' to 'Why are we wasting our time? Let's not do this.'\"\n\nAdam Grenier: This energy around, let's just do the thing we're supposed to do. And I think that's maybe specifically applicable to our environment, to high growth and marketing and product where it's just, that's just a key ingredient to doing this job well, is adaptability and flexibility and exploration.

Because if anything, I see the opposite for people that are exhausted, where they get re-motivated by new stuff, by opportunities to go do something different and that kind of stuff.\n\nLenny: Wow. Really good insight. Second to last question, I know you have to run, where are you on this journey today and then just what's next for Adam Grenier?\n\nAdam Grenier: Yeah, thank you. Good question. I'm constantly optimizing this matrix of what am I good at versus what do I love doing? And so what I've found is that I really love entrepreneurs and working really closely with entrepreneurs and helping them figure out all of these funky things that I've been able to see over the last 20 years and maneuver. And I've worked at a lot of places and so I'm really good at context changing and helping connect the dots for people.\n\nAdam Grenier: And so a couple ways I've found to be able to do that is advising companies, so working with founders and growth leaders and things like that and investing. And so I'm actually right now, I've been investing now for six, seven years. I've recently joined Andreessen's Scout fund, so I'm doing a bit more volume now. But I would say if I had to make a bet right now, I think a full-time or closer to full-time investing world is what I'd like to lean more towards.

You don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. The second difference is the agency control trade-off. Every time you hand over decision-making capabilities to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: This significantly changes the way you should be building product.\n\nKiriti Badam: So we recommend building step-by-step. When you start small, it forces you to think about what is the problem that I'm going to solve.

Successful companies right now building in any new area, they are going through the pain of learning this, implementing this and understanding what works and what doesn't work. Pain is the new moat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Today, my guests are Aishwarya Reganti and Kiriti Badam. Kiriti works on Kodex at OpenAI and has spent the last decade building AI and ML infrastructure at Google and at Kumo. Ash was an early AI researcher at Alexa and Microsoft and has published over 35 research papers. Together, they've led and supported over 50 AI product deployments across companies like Amazon, Databricks, OpenAI, Google, and both startups and large enterprises. Together, they also teach the number one rated AI course on Maven, where they teach product leaders all of the key lessons they've learned about building successful AI products. The goal of this episode is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering and wasted time trying to build your AI product. Whether you are already struggling to make your product work or want to avoid that struggle, this episode is for you.

With that, I bring you Aishwarya, Reganti, and Kiriti Badam after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: This episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders hate building integrations. They're messy. They're slow to build. They're a huge drain on your roadmap, and they're definitely not why you got into product in the first place. Lucky for you, Merge is obsessed with integrations. With a single API, B2B SaaS companies embed Merge into their product and ship 220 plus customer-facing integrations in weeks, not quarters.",

Companies like Mistral AI, Ramp, and Drata use Merge to connect their customers as accounting, HR, ticketing, CRM, and file storage systems to power everything from automatic onboarding to AI-ready data pipelines. Even better, Merge now supports the secure deployment of connectors to AI agents with a new product so that you can safely power AI workflows with real customer data. If your product needs customer data from dozens of systems, Merge is the fastest, safest way to get it. Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny, and they'll send you a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Strella, the customer research platform built for the AI era. Here's the truth about user research. It's never been more important or more painful. Teams want to understand why customers do what they do, but recruiting users running interviews and analyzing insights takes weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: By the time the results are in, the moment to act has passed. Strella changes that. It's the first platform that uses AI to run and analyze in depth interviews automatically, bringing fast and continuous user research to every team. Strella's AI moderator asks real follow-up questions, probing deeper when answers are vague, and services patterns across hundreds of conversations all in a few hours, not weeks. Product, design, and research teams at companies like Amazon and Duolingo are already using Strella for Figma prototype testing, concept validation, and customer journey research, getting insights overnight instead of waiting for the next sprint. If your team wants to understand customers at the speed you ship products, try Strella. Run your next study at strella.io/lenny. That's S-T-R-E-L-L-A.io/lenny.

You also teach a course on building AI products successfully and you're kind of on this mission to just reduce pain and suffering and failure that you constantly see people go through when they're building AI products. So to set a little just foundation for the conversation we're going to have, what are you seeing on the ground within companies trying to build AI products? What's going well? What's not going well?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think 2025 has been significantly different than 2024. One, the skepticism has significantly reduced. There were tons of leaders last year who probably thought this would be yet another crypto wave and kind of skeptical to get started. And a lot of the use cases that I saw last year were more of slap chat on your data. And that was calling themselves an AI product. And this year, a ton of companies are really rethinking their user experiences and their workflows and all of that and really understanding that you need to deconstruct and reconstruct your processes in order to build successful AI products. And that's the good stuff. The bad stuff is the execution is still all over the place. Think of it. This is a three-year-old field. There are no playbooks, there are no textbooks. So you really need to figure out as you go. And the AI lifecycle, both pre-deployment and post-deployment is very different as compared to a traditional software lifecycle.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And so a lot of old contracts and handoffs between traditional roles, like say PMs and engineers and data folks has now been broken and people are really getting adapted to this new way of working together and kind of owning the same feedback loop in a way. Because previously, I feel like PMs and engineers and all of these folks had their own feedback loops to optimize. And now you need to be probably sitting in the same room. You're probably looking at agent traces together and deciding how your product should behave. So it's a tighter form of collaboration. So companies are still kind of figuring that out. That's kind of what I see in my consulting practice this year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: So let me follow that thread. We worked on a guest post together that came out a few months ago. And the thing that stood out to me most that stuck with me most after working on that post is this really key insight that building AI products is very different from building non-AI products. And the thing that you're big on getting across is there's two very big differences. Talk about those two differences.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: Yes. And again, I want to make sure that we drive home the right point. There are tons of similarities of building AI systems and software systems as well, but then there are some things that kind of fundamentally change the way you build software systems versus AI systems. And one of them that most people tend to ignore is the non-determinism. You're pretty much working with a non-deterministic API as compared to traditional software. What does that mean and why does that have to affect us is in traditional software, you pretty much have a very well-mapped decision engine or workflow. Think of something like Booking.com. You have an intention that you want to make a booking in San Francisco for two nights, et cetera. The product has kind of been built so that your intention can be converted into a particular action and you kind of are clicking through a bunch of buttons, options, forms, and all of that, and you finally achieve your intention.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: But now that layer in AI products has completely been replaced by a very fluid interface, which is mostly natural language, which means the user can literally come up with a ton of ways of saying or communicating their intentions. And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And with agentic systems, this kind of gets even harder. And that's where we talk about the second difference, which is the agency control trade-off. What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: So just to summarize what you're sharing here, essentially, people have been building product, software products for a long time. We're now in a world where the software you're building is one, non-deterministic, can just do things differently. As you said, you go to booking.com, you find a hotel, it's going to be the same experience every time. You'll see different hotels, but it's a predictable experience. With AI, you can't predict that it's going to be the exact same thing, the thing that you plan it to be every time. And then the other is there's this trade-off between agency and control. How much will the AI do for you versus how much should the person still be in charge? And what I'm hearing is the big point here is this significantly changes the way you should be building product. And we're going to talk about the impact on how the product development lifecycle should change as a result.",

    "text": "Lenny Rachitsky: Is there anything else you want to add there before we get into that?\n\nKiriti Badam: Yeah, it's definitely one of the key points that this kind of distinction needs to exist in your mind when you're starting to build. For example, think about if your objective is to hike Half Dome in Yosemite. You don't start hiking it every day, but you start training yourself in minor parts and then you slowly improve and then you go to the end goal. I feel like that's extremely similar to what you want to build AI products in the sense that when you don't start with agents with all the tools and all the context that you have in the company in day one and expect it to work or even tinker at that level. You need to be deliberately starting in places where there is minimal impact and more human control so that you have a good grip of what are the current capabilities and what can I do with them and then slowly lean into the more agency and lesser control.\n\nKiriti Badam: So this gives you that confidence that, okay, I can know that, okay, this is the particular problem that I'm facing and the AI can solve this extent of it. And then let me next think through what context I need to bring in, what kind of tools I need to add to this to improve the experience. So I feel like also it's a good and a bad thing in the sense that it's good that you don't have to see the complexity of the outside world of all of this fancy AI agents force and feel like I cannot do that. Everyone is starting from very minimalistic structures and then evolving. And the second part is the bad thing is that as you are trying to build this one click agents into your company, you don't have to be overwhelmed with this complexity. You can slowly graduate.\n\nKiriti Badam: So that's extremely important. And we see this as a repeating pattern over and over.",

    "text": "Lenny Rachitsky: Okay. So let's actually follow that because that's a really important component of how you recommend people build AI stuff, AI products, AI agents, all the AI things. So give us an example of what you're talking about here, this idea of starting slow with agency and control and then moving up this rung.\n\nKiriti Badam: Yeah. For example, a very important or very prevalent application of AI agents is customer support. Imagine you are a company who has a lot of customer support tickets and why even imagine OpenAI is the exact same thing when we were launching products and there was a huge spike of support volume as we launched successful products like Image or GPT-5 and things like that. The kind of questions you get is different. The kind of problems that the customers bring to you is different. So it's not about just dumping all the list of help center articles that you have into the AI agent. You kind of understand what are the things that you can build. And so initially the first step of it would be something like you have your support agents, the human support agents, but you will be suggesting in terms of, okay, this is what the AI thinks that is the right thing to do.\n\nKiriti Badam: And then you get that feedback loop from the humans that, okay, this is actually a good suggestion for me in this particular case and this is a bad suggestion. And then you can go back and understand, okay, this is what the drawbacks are or this is where the blind spots are, and then how do I fix that? And once you get that, you can increase the autonomy to say that, okay, I don't need to suggest to the human. I'll actually show the answer directly to the customer. And then we can actually add more complexity in terms of, okay, I was only answering questions based on health center articles, but now let me add new functionality. I can actually issue refunds to the customers. I can actually raise feature requests with the engineering team and all of these things. So if you start with all of this on day one, it's incredibly hard to control the complexity.\n\nKiriti Badam: So we recommend building step by step and then increasing it.",

    "text": "Lenny Rachitsky: Awesome. And you have a visual actually that we'll share of what this looks like. But just to kind of mirror back what you're describing, this idea of start with high control, low agency, the example you gave is the support agents just kind of giving suggestions, is not able to do anything, the user is in charge. And then as that becomes useful and you are confident it's doing the right sort of work, you give it a little more agency and you kind of pull back on the control the user has. And then if that's starting to go well, then you give it more agency and the user needs less control to control it. Awesome.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think the higher level idea here is with AI systems, it's all about behavior calibration. It's incredibly impossible to predict upfront how your system behaves. Now, what do you do about it? You make sure that you don't ruin your customer experience or your end user experience. You keep that as is, but then remove the amount of control that the human has. And there is no single right way of doing it. You can decide how to constrain that autonomy. I mean, a different example of how you could constrain autonomy is pre-authorization use cases. Insurance pre-authorization is a very ripe use case for AI because clinicians spend a lot of time pre-authorizing things like blood tests, MRIs and things like that. And there are some cases which are more of low hanging fruits. For instance, MRIs and block tests, because as soon as you know patient's information, it's easier to approve that and AI could do that versus something like an invasive surgery, et cetera, is more high risk. You don't want to be doing that autonomously.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: So you can kind of determine which of these use cases should go through that human and the loop layer versus which of the use cases AI can conveniently handle. And then all through this process, you're also logging what the human is doing because you want to build a flywheel that you could use in order to improve your system. So you're essentially not showing the user experience, not eroding trust, at the same time logging what humans would otherwise do so that you can continuously improve your system.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: So let me give you a few more examples of this kind of progression that you recommend. And the reason I'm spending so much time here is this is a really key part of your recommendation to help people build more successful AI products. This idea of start slow with high control and low agency and then build up over time once you've built confidence that it's doing the right sort of work. So a few more examples that you shared in your post that I'll just read. So say you're building a coding assistant, V1 would be just suggest inline completion and boilerplate snippets. V2 would be generate larger blocks like tests or refactors for humans to review. And then V3 is just apply the changes and open PRs autonomously. And then another example is a marketing assistant. So V1 would be draft emails or social copy, just like here's what I would do.",

    "text": "Lenny Rachitsky: V2 is build a multi-step campaign and run the campaign. And V3 is just launch it A/B tested auto-optimize campaigns across channels. Awesome. Yeah. And again, just to summarize where we're at, just to give people the advice we've shared so far. One is just important to understand AI products are different. They're non-deterministic. And you pointed out, and I forgot to actually mirror back this point, both on the input and the output. The user experience is non-deterministic.People will see different things, different outputs, different chat conversations, different maybe UI if it's designing the UI for you. And also the output obviously is going to be non-terministic. So that's a problem and a challenge. And then-\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I mean, if you think of it's also the most beautiful part of AI, which is, I mean, we are all much more comfortable talking than following a bunch of buttons and all of that. So the bar to using AI products is much lower because you can be as natural as you would be with humans, but that's also the problem, which is there are tons of ways we communicate and you want to make sure that that intent is rightly communicated and the right actions are taken because most of your systems are deterministic and you want to achieve a deterministic outcome, but with non-deterministic technology and that's where it gets a little messy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Awesome. Okay. I love the optimistic version of why this is good. Okay. And then the other piece is this idea of this trade-off of autonomy versus control when you're designing a thing. And I imagine what you're seeing is people try to jump to the ideal, like the V3 immediately and that's when they get into trouble both. It's probably a lot harder to build that and it just doesn't work. And then they're just like, \"Okay, this is a failure. What are we even doing?\"\n\nKiriti Badam: Exactly. I feel there's a bunch of things that you actually have to get confidence in before you get to V3. And it's easy to get overwhelmed that, oh, my AI agent is doing these things wrong in a hundred different ways and you're not going to actually tabulate all of them and fix it. Even though you've learned how do you deal with the evaluation practices and stuff like that, if you're starting on the wrong spot, you are actually going to have a hard time correcting things from there. And when you start small and when you start with building a very minimalistic version with high human control and low agency, it also forces you to think about what is the problem that I'm going to solve. We use this term called problem first. And to me, it was obvious in the sense that that I do need to think about the problem, but it's incredible how well it resonates with the people that in all this advancements of the AI that we are seeing, one easy, slippery slope is to just keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve.",

So that is incredibly useful and we keep repeating this part and over and over with everyone we talk to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: And there's so many other benefits to limiting autonomy because there's just danger also of the thing doing too much for you and just messing up your, I don't know, your database, sending out all these emails you never expected. And there's like so many reasons this is a good idea.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Yep. I recently read this paper from a bunch of folks at UC Berkeley. Basically Matei Zaharia, [inaudible 00:21:54] and the folks at Databricks and it said about 74% or 75% of the enterprises that they had spoken to, their biggest problem was reliability. And that's also why they weren't comfortable deploying products to their end users or building customer facing products because they just weren't sure or they just weren't comfortable doing that and exposing their users to a bunch of these risks. And that's also why they think a lot of AI products today have to do with productivity because it's much low autonomy versus end-to-end agents that would replace workflows. And yeah, I love their work otherwise as well, but I think that's very in line with what at least we are seeing at my startup as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Okay. Very interesting. There's an episode that'll come out before this conversation where we go deep into another problem that this avoids, which is around prompt injection and jailbreaking and just how big of a risk that is for AI products where it's essentially an unsolved and unsolvable problem potentially. I'm not going to go down that track, but that's a pretty scary conversation we had that'll be out before this conversation.",

We're still so busy building AI products that we're not worried about security, but it will be such a huge problem to kind of, especially with this non-deterministic API again. So you're kind of stuck because there are tons of instructions that you could inject within your prompt and then it's going really bad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Okay. Let's actually spend a little time here because it's actually really interesting to me and no one's talking about this stuff, which is like the conversation we had is just it's pretty easy to get AI to do stuff it shouldn't do. And there's all these guardrail systems people put in place, but turns out these guardrails aren't actually very good and you can always get around them. And to your point, as agents become more autonomous and robots, it gets pretty scary that you could get AI to do things you shouldn't do.\n\nKiriti Badam: I think this is definitely a problem, but I feel in the current spectrum of customers adopting AI, the extent to which companies can actually get advantage of AI or improve their processes or streamline the existing processes that they have, I feel it's still in the very early stage. 2025 has been an extremely busy year for AI agents and customers trying to adopt AI, but I feel the penetration is still not as much as you would actually get advantage out of it. So with the right sort of human in the loop points in here, I feel we can actually avoid a bunch of these things and focus more towards streamlining the processes. And I am more on the optimist side in the sense that you need to try and adopt this before actually trying to be only for highlighting the negative aspects of what could go wrong.\n\nKiriti Badam: So I feel like strongly that companies has this adopt this, they definitely ... No company at OpenAI we talk to has never had been the case that, oh, AI cannot help me in this case.

And to your point, there's a lot of things to focus on. It's one of many things to worry about and think about. Okay, let's get back on track here. So we've shared a bunch of pro-tips and important piece of advice. Let me ask, what other patterns and kind of ways of working do you see in companies that do this well and teams that build AI products successfully? And then just what are the most common pitfalls people fall into? So we could just maybe start with, what are other ways that companies do this well, build AI products successfully?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I almost think of it as like a success triangle with three dimensions that's never always technical. Every technology problem is a people problem first. And with companies that we have worked with, it's these three dimensions, like great leaders, good culture and technical prowess. With leaders itself, we work with a lot of companies for their AI transformation, training, strategy and stuff like that. And I feel like a lot of companies, the leaders have built intuitions over 10 or 15 years and they're kind of highly regarded for those intuitions. But now with AI in the picture, those intuitions will have to be relearned and leaders have to be vulnerable to do that. I used to work with the CEO of now Rackspace, Gagan. So he would have this block every day in the morning, which would say catching up with AI 4:00 to 6:00 AM, and he would not have any meetings or anything like that.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And that was just his time to pick up on the latest AI podcast or information and all of that. And he would have weekend vibe coding sessions and stuff like that. So I think leaders have to get back to being hands-on. And that's not because they have to be implementing these things, but more of rebuilding their intuitions because you must be comfortable with the fact that your intuitions might not be right and you probably are the dumbest person in the room and you want to learn from everyone. And that I've seen that being a very distinguishing factor of companies that build products which are successful because you're kind of bringing in that top-down approach. It's almost always impossible for it to be bottom-up. You can't have a bunch of engineers go and get buy-in from the leader if they just don't trust in the technology or if they have misaligned expectations about the technology.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I've heard from so many folks who are building that our leaders just don't understand the extent to which AI can solve a particular problem or they just vibe code something and assume it's easy to take it to production and you really need to understand the range of what AI can solve today so that you can guide decisions within the company. The second one is the culture itself. And again, I work with enterprises where AI is not their main thing and they need to bring in AI into their processes just because a competitor is doing it. And just because it does make sense because there are use cases that are very ripe. Then along the way, I feel a lot of companies have this culture of FOMO and you will be replaced and those kind of things and people get really afraid. Subject matter experts are such a huge part of building AI products that work because you really need to consult them to understand how your AI is behaving or what the ideal behavior should be.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: But then I've spoken to a bunch of companies where the subject matter experts just don't want to talk to you because they think their job is being replaced. So I mean, again, this comes from the leader itself. You want to build a culture of empowerment, of augmenting AI into your own workflows so that you can 10X at what you're doing instead of saying that probably you'll be replaced if you don't adopt AI and stuff like that. So that kind of an empowering culture always helps. You want to make your entire organization be in it together and make AI work for you instead of trying to guard their own jobs, et cetera. And with AI, it's also true that it opens up a lot more opportunities than before. So you could have your employees doing a lot more things than before and 10x their productivity. And the third one is the technical part which we talk about.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think folks that are successful are incredibly obsessed about understanding their workflows very well and augmenting parts that could be ripe for AI versus the ones that might need human in the loop somewhere, et cetera. Whenever you're trying to automate some part of a workflow, it's never the case that you could use an AI agent and that will solve your problems. It's always, you probably have a machine learning model that's going to do some part of the job. You have deterministic code doing some part of the job. So you really need to be obsessed with understanding that workflow so you can choose the right tool for the problem instead of being obsessed with the technology itself. And another pattern I see is also folks really understand this idea of working with a non-deterministic API, which is your LLM. And what that means is they also understand the AI development lifecycle looks very different and they iterate pretty quickly, which is can I build something iterate quickly in a way that it doesn't ruin my customer experience at the same time gives me enough amount of data so that I can estimate behavior.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: So they build that flywheel very quickly. As of today, it's not about being the first company to have an agent among your competitors. It's about, have you built the right flywheels in place so that you can improve over time? When someone comes up to me and says, \"We have this one click agent, it's going to be deployed in your system.\" And then in two or three days, it'll start showing you significant gains. I would almost be skeptical because it's just not possible. And that's not because the models aren't there, but because enterprise data and infrastructure is very messy and you need a bit to ... Even the agent needs a bit to understand how these systems work. There are very messy taxonomies everywhere. People tend to do things like get customer data, we want, get customer data, we do, and these kind of things. And all those functions exist and they're being called and basically there's a lot of tech debt that you need to deal with.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: So most of the times, if you're obsessed with the problem itself and you understand your workflows very well, you will know how to improve your agents over time instead of just slapping an agent and assuming that it'll work from day one. I probably will go as far to say that if someone's selling you one click-agents, it's pure marketing. You don't want to buy into that. I would rather go with a company that says, \"We're going to build this pipeline for you,\" and that will learn over time and build a flywheel to improve than something that's going to work out of the box. To replace any critical workflow or to build something that can give you significant ROI, it easily takes four to six months of work, even if you have the best data layer and infrastructure layer.",

It's been a hot topic on this podcast. It was a hot topic on Twitter for a while, evals. A lot of people are obsessed with evals, think they're the solution to a lot of problems in AI. A lot of people think they're overrated that you don't need evals. You can just feel the vibes and you'll be all right. What's your take on evals? How far does that take people in solving a lot of the problems that you talk about?\n\nKiriti Badam: In terms of what is going on in the community, I feel there's just this false dichotomy of this either evals is going to solve everything or online monitoring or production monitoring is going to solve everything. And I find no reason to trust one of the extremes in the sense that I will entirely bank my application on this or like that to solve the thing. So if you take a step back, think of what are evals. Evals are basically your trusted product thinking or your knowledge about the product that is going into this set of data sets that you're going to build in the sense that this is what matters to me. This is the kind of problems that my agent should not do and let me build a list of datasets so that I'm going to do well on those.

    "text": "Kiriti Badam: You could be deploying any agent and if the customer is giving a thumbs up for your interaction, you better want to know that. So that is what production monitoring is going to do. And this production monitoring has existed for products for a long time, just that now with the AI agents, you need to be monitoring a lot more granularity. It's not just the customer always giving you explicit feedback, but there is many implicit feedback that you can get. For example, in ChatGPT, if you are liking the answer, you can actually give a thumbs up. Or if you don't like the answer, sometimes customers don't give you thumbs down, but actually regenerate the answer. So that is a clear indication that the initial answer that regenerator is not meeting the customer's expectation. So these are the kind of implicit signals you always need to think about.\n\nKiriti Badam: And that spectrum has been increasing in terms of production monitoring. Now let's come back to the initial topic of like, okay, is it evals or is it production monitoring? What does it matter? So I feel, again, we go back to this problem first approach of what is it that you're trying to build. You're trying to build a reliable application for your customers that's not going to do a bad thing. It's always going to do the right thing. Or if it is doing a wrong thing, you're basically alerted very quickly. So I break this down into two parts. One is nobody goes into deploying an application without actually just testing that. This testing could be wipes or this testing could be, \"Okay, I have this 10 questions that it should not go wrong no matter what changes I make, and let me build this and let's call this an evaluation dataset.\" Now, let's say you build this, you deployed this, and then you figured, \"Okay, now I need to understand whether it's doing the right thing or not.\"\n\nKiriti Badam: So if you're a high throughput or a high transaction customer, you cannot practically sit and evaluate all the traces. You need some indication to understand what are the things that I should look at. And this is where production monitoring comes into the picture that you cannot predict the base in which your agent could be doing wrong, but all of these other implicit signals and explicit signals, those are going to communicate back to you what are the traces that you need to look at. And that is where production monitoring helps. And once you get this kind of traces, you need to examine what are the failure patterns that you're seeing in these different types of interactions. And is there something that I really care about that should not happen? And if that kind of failure modes are happening, then I need to think about building an evaluation dataset for it.\n\nKiriti Badam: And okay, let's say I built an evaluation dataset for my agent trying to offer refunds where explicitly I have configured it not to. So I built this evaluation dataset and then I made my changes in tools or prompts or whatever, and then I deployed the second version of the product. Now there is no guarantee that this is the only problem that you're going to see. You still need production monitoring to actually catch different kinds of problems that you might encounter. So I feel evals are important, production monitoring is important, but this notion of only one of them is going to solve things for you that is completely dismissible in my opinion.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: Lawyers and doctors write evals, that doesn't mean they're building LLM judges or they're building this entire feedback loop. And when you say that a PM should be writing evals, doesn't mean they have to write an LLM judge that's good enough for production. I think there are also very prescriptive ways of doing this and plus one to KD, which is you cannot predict upfront if you need to be building an LLM judge versus you need to be using implicit signals from production monitoring, et cetera. I think Martin Fowler at some point had this term called semantic diffusion back in the 2000s, which kind of means that someone comes up with a term, everybody starts butchering it with their own definitions and then you kind of lose the actual definition of it. That is what is happening to evals or agents or any word in AI as of today, everybody kind of sees a different side to it, I guess.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: But if you make a bunch of practitioners sit together and ask them, \"Is it important to build an actionable feedback loop for AI products?\" I think all of them will agree. Now, how you do that really depends on your application itself. When you go to complex use cases, it's incredibly hard to build LLM judges because you see a lot of emerging patterns. If you built a judge that would test for verbosity or something like that, it turns out that you're seeing newer patterns that your LLM judge is not able to catch, and then you just end up building too many evals. And at that point, it just makes sense to look at your user signals, fix them, check if you have regressed and move on instead of actually building these judges. So it all depends. I think one statement that every ML practitioner will tell you is it really depends on the context. Don't be obsessed with prescriptions they're going to change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: That's such an important point, this idea that, especially that evals just means many things to different people now. It's just a term for so many things. And it's complicated to just talk about evals when you see it as the stuff data labeling companies are giving you and things PMR, right? And there's also benchmarks. People call benchmarks a little bit evals. It's like-\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I recently spoke to a client who told me, \"We do evals.\" And I was like, \"Okay, can you show me your dataset?\" And said, \"No, we just checked LM Arena and Artificial Analysis. These are independent benchmarks and we know that this model is the right one for our use case.\" And I'm like, \"You're not doing evals. That's not evals. Those are model evals.\"",

And I think Alex has been on your podcast recently and he's been talking about how you're extremely focused on building the right product. And a big part of it is basically listening to your customers. And coding agents are extremely unique compared to agents for other domains in the sense that these are actually built for customizability and these are built for engineers. So coding agent is not a product which is going to solve these top five workflows or top six workflows or whatever. It's meant to be customizable in multi different ways.

For example, we built this code review product recently and it has been gaining extreme amount of traction.

And now let's say if I'm making a model change to the code review or a different kinds of RL mechanism that I trained with it, and now if I'm going to deploy it, I definitely do want A/B test and identify whether it's actually finding the right mistakes and how are users reacting to it?

And every new model that you're going to launch, we get together as a team and test different things. Each person is concentrating on something else. And we have this list of hard problems that we have and we throw that to the model and see how well they're progressing. So it's like custom evals for each engineer, you would say, and just understand what the product is doing in its new model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: If you're a founder, the hardest part of starting a company isn't having the idea, it's scaling the business without getting buried in back office work. That's where Brex comes in. Brex is the intelligent finance platform for founders. With Brex, you get high limit corporate cards, easy banking, high yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents that handle manual finance tasks for you. They'll do all the stuff that you don't want to do, like file your expenses, scour transactions for waste, and run reports all according to your rules. With Brex's AI agents, you can move faster while staying in full control. One in three startups in the United States already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: We've been talking for almost an hour already, and we haven't even covered your extremely powerful software development workflow for building AI products that you two developed that you teach in your course, that you basically combined all the stuff we've been talking about into a step-by-step approach to building AI products. You call it the continuous calibration, continuous development framework. Let's pull up a visual to show people what the heck we're talking about, and then just walk us through what this is, how this works, how teams can shift the way they build their AI products to this approach to help them avoid a lot of pain and suffering.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: Before we go about explaining the life cycle, a quick story on why Kiriti and I came up with this is because there are tons of companies that we keep talking to that have the pressure from their competitors because they're all building agents. We should be building agents that are entirely autonomous. And I did end up working with a few customers where we built these end-to-end agents. And turns out that because you start off at a place where you don't know how the user might interact with your system and what kind of responses or actions the AI might come up with, it's really hard to fix problems when you have this really huge workflow, which is taking four or five steps, making tons of decisions. You just end up debugging so much and then kind of hot fixing to the point where at a time we were building for a customer support use case, which is the example that we give in the newsletter as well.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And we had to shut down the product because we were doing so many hot fixes and there was no way we could count all the emerging problems that were coming up. And there's also quite some news online. Recently, I think Air Canada had this thing where one of their agents predicted or hallucinated a policy for a refund, which was not part of their original playbook, and they had to go by it because legal stuff. And there have been a ton of really scary incidents. And that's where the idea comes from. How can you build so that you don't lose customer trust and you don't end up, or your agent or AI system doesn't end up making decisions that are super dangerous to the company itself. At the same time, build a flywheel so that you can improve your product as you go. And that's where we came up with this idea of continuous calibration, continuous development.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: The idea is pretty simple, which is we have this right side of the loop, which is continuous development, where you scope capability and curate data, essentially get a data set of what your expected inputs are and what your expected outputs should be looking at. This is a very good exercise before you start building any AI product because many times you figure out that a lot of the folks within the team are just not aligned on how the product should behave. And that's where your PMs can really give in a lot more information and your subject matter experts as well. So you have this data set that you know your AI product should be doing really well on. It's not comprehensive, but it lets you get started. And then you set up the application and then design the right kind of evaluation metrics. And I intentionally use the term evaluation metrics, although we say evals because I just want to be very specific in what it is because evaluation is a process, evaluation metrics are dimensions that you want to focus on during the process.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And then you go about deploying, run your evaluation metrics. And the second part is the continuous calibration, which is the part where you understand what behavior you hadn't expected in the beginning, right? Because when you start the development process, you have this data set that you're optimizing for, but more often than not, you realize that that data set is not comprehensive enough because users start behaving with your systems in ways that you did not predict. And that's where you want to do the calibration piece. I've deployed my system. Now I see that there are patterns that I did not really expect and your evaluation metrics should give you some insight into those patterns, but sometimes you figure out that those metrics were also not enough and you probably have new error patterns that you have not thought about. And that's where you analyze your behavior, spot error patterns.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: You apply fixes for issues that you see, but you also design newer evaluation metrics to figure out that they are emerging patterns. And that doesn't mean you should always design evaluation metrics. There are some errors that you can just fix and not really come back to because they're very spot errors. For instance, there's a tool calling error just because your tool wasn't defined well and stuff like that. You can just fix it and move on. And this is pretty much how an AI product lifecycle would look like. But what we specifically also mention is while you're going through these iterations, try to think of lower agency iterations in the beginning and higher control iterations. What that means is constrain the number of decisions your AI systems can make and make sure that they're humans in the loop and then increase that over time because you're kind of building a flywheel of behavior and you're understanding what kind of use cases are coming in or how your users are using the system.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And one example I think we give in the newsletter itself is the customer support. This is a nice image that kind of shows how you can think of agency and control as two dimensions. And each of your versions keep on increasing the agency or the ability of your AI system to make decisions and lower the control as you go. And one example that we give is that of the customer support agent, where you can break it down into three versions. The first version is just routing, which is your agent able to classify and route a particular ticket to the right department? And sometimes when you read this, you probably think, is it so hard to just do routing? Why can't an agent easily do that? And when you go to enterprises, routing itself can be a super complex problem. Any retail company, any popular retail company that you can think of has hierarchical taxonomies.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Most of the times the taxonomies are incredibly messy. I have worked in use cases where you probably have taxonomy that says some kind of hierarchy and then that says shoes and then women's shoes and men's shoes all at the same layer where idea you should be having shoes and then women's shoes and men's shoes should be subclasses. And then you're like, okay, fine. I could just merge that. And you go further and you see that there's also another section on the shoes that says for women and for men, and it's just not aggregated. It's not fixed for some reason. So if an agent kind of sees this kind of a taxonomy, what is it supposed to do? Where is it supposed to route? And a lot of the times we are not aware of these problems until you actually go about building something and understanding it.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And when these kind of problems, real human agents see these kind of problems, they know what to check next. Maybe they realize that the node that says for women and for men that's under shoes was last updated in 2019, which means that it's just a dead node that's lying there and not being used. So they kind of know that, okay, we're supposed to be looking at a different node and stuff like that. And I'm not saying agents cannot understand this or models are not capable enough to understand this, but there are really weird rules within enterprises that are not documented anywhere. And you want to make sure that the agents have all of that context instead of just throwing the problem at that.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: Yeah. Coming back to the versions we had, routing was one where you have really high control because even if your agent routes to the wrong department, humans can take control and undo those actions. And along the way, you also figure out that you probably are dealing with a ton of data issues that you need to fix and make sure that your data layer is good enough for the agent to function. We do is what we said of a Copilot, which is now that you've figured out routing works fine after a few iterations and you've fixed all of your data issues, you could go to the next step, which is, can my agent provide suggestions based on some standard operating procedures that we have for the customer support agent? And it could just generate a draft that the human can make changes to. And when you do this, you're also logging human behavior, which means that how much of this draft was used by the customer support agent or what was omitted. So you're actually getting error analysis for free when you do this because you're literally logging everything that the user is doing that you could then build back into your flywheel.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And then we say, post that, once you've figured out that those drafts look good and most of the times maybe humans are not making too many changes, they're using these drafts as is. That's when you want to go to your end-to-end resolution assistant that could draft a resolution that could solve the ticket as well. And those are the stages of agency where you start with low agency and then you go up high. We also have this really nice table that we put together, which is what do you do at each version and what you learn that can enable you to go to the next step and what information do you get that you can feed into the loop, right? When you're just doing your routing, you have better quality routing data, you also know what kind of prompts you need to be building to improve the routing system.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Essentially, you're figuring out your structure for context engineering and building that flywheel that you want. And while I go through this, I want to also be very clear that two things. One is when you build with CCCD in mind, it doesn't mean that you've fixed the problem all for one. It's possible that you've probably gone through V3 and you see a new distribution of data that you never previously imagined, but this is just one way to lower your risk, which is you get enough information about how users behave with your system before going to a point of complete autonomy. And the second thing is you're also kind of building this implicit logging system. A lot of people come and tell us that, \"Oh, wait, there are evals. Why do you need something like this? \" The issue with just building a bunch of evaluation metrics and then having them in production is evaluation metrics catch only the errors that you're already aware of, but there can be a lot of emerging patterns that you understand only after you put things in production.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: So for those emerging patterns, you're kind of creating a low risk kind of a framework so that you could understand user behavior and not really be in a position where there are tons of errors and you're trying to fix all of them at once. And this is not the only way to do it. There are tons of different ways. You want to decide how you constrain your autonomy. It could be based on the number of actions that the agent is taking, which is what we do in this example. It could be based on topic. There's just some domains where it's pretty high risk to make a system completely autonomous for certain decisions, but for some other topics, it's okay to make them completely autonomous and depending on the complexity of the problem. And that's where you really want your product managers, your engineers and subject matter experts to align on how to build this system and continuously improve it.",

You basically go through all of these steps by step, a bunch of examples. And the idea here is, as you said, that the reason, everything about what you're describing here is about making it continuous and iterative and kind of moving along this progression of higher autonomy, less control. And this idea of even calling continuous calibration, continuous development is communicating it's this kind of iterative process. And just to be clear, this naming is kind of ode to CI/CD, continuous integration, continuous deployment suite. And the idea here is that this is the version of that for AI where instead of just integrating into unit tests and deploying constantly, it's running evals, looking at results, iterating on the metrics you're watching, figuring out where it's breaking and iterating on that. Awesome. Okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: So again, we'll point people to this post if they want to go deeper. That was a great overview. Is there anything else before we go into different topic around this framework specifically that you think is important for people to know?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think one of the most common questions we get is, how do I know if I need to go to the next stage or if this is calibrated enough? There's not really a rule book you can follow, but it's all about minimizing surprise, which means let's say you're calibrating every one or two days and you figure out that you're not seeing new data distribution patterns, your users have been pretty consistent with how they're behaving with the system. Then the amount of information you gain is kind of very low and that's when you know you can actually go to the next stage. And it's all about the wipes at that point, do you know you're ready, you're not receiving any new information. But also it really helps to understand that sometimes there are events that could completely mess up the calibration of your system. An example is GPT-4o doesn't exist anymore, or it's going to be deprecated in APIs as well.",

    "text": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti: So most companies that were using 4o should switch to 5 and 5 has very different properties. So that's where your calibration's off again. You want to go back and do this process again. Sometimes users start behaving with systems also differently over time or user behavior evolves. Even with consumer products, you don't talk to ChatGPT the same way you were talking, say, two years ago, just because you know the capabilities have increased so much. And also just people get excited when these systems can solve one task, they want to try it out on other tasks as well. We built this system for underwriters at some point. Underwriting is a painful task. There are agreements that are like loan applications are like 30 or 40 pages, and the idea for this bank was to build a system that could help underwriters pick policies and information about the bank so that they could approve loans.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And for a good three or four months, everybody was pretty impressed with the system. We had underwriters actually report gains in terms of how much time they were spending, et cetera. And first three months, we realized that they were so excited with the product that they started asking very deep questions that we never anticipated. They would just throw the entire application document at the system and go, \"For a case that looks like this, what did previous underwriters do? \" And for a user, that just seems like a natural extension of what they were doing, but the building behind it should significantly change. Now, you need to understand what does for a case like this mean in the context of the loan itself? Is it referring to people of a particular income range or is it referring to people in a particular geo and stuff like that?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And then you need to pick up historical documents, analyze those documents, and then tell them, \"Okay, this is what it looks like,\" versus just saying that there's a policy X, Y, and Z, and you want to look up that policy. So something that might seem very natural to an end user might be very hard to build as a product builder, and you see that user behavior also evolves over time, and that's when you know that you want to go back and recalibrate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: What do you think is overhyped in the AI space right now?

People have this notion of, \"I have this incredibly complex problem. Now I'm going to break it down into, hey, you are this agent. Take care of this. You're this agent. Take care of this.\" And now if I somehow connect all of these agents, they think they're the agent utopia and it's never the case that there are incredibly successful multi-agent systems that are built. There's no doubt about that. But I feel a lot of it comes in terms of how are you limiting the ways in which the system can go off tracks. And for example, if you're building a supervisor agent and there are subagents that actually do the work for the super agent, supervisor agent, that is a very successful pattern.\n\nKiriti Badam: But coming with this notion of I'm going to divide the responsibilities based on functionality and somehow expect all of that to work together in some sort of gossip protocol, that is extremely misunderstood that you could do that. I don't think current ways of building and current model capabilities are right there in terms of building those kind of applications. I feel that is kind of misunderstood than overrated. Underrated, I feel it's hard to probably believe, but I still feel coding agents are underrated in the sense that I feel like you can go on Twitter and you can go on Reddit and you see a lot of chatter about coding agents, but talking to an engineer in any random company, especially outside of Bay Area, you can see the amount of impact this coding agents can create and the penetration is very low. So I feel like 2025 and 2026 is going to be an incredible year for optimizing all of these processes.\n\nKiriti Badam: And I feel that is going to be creating a lot of value with AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: That's really interesting on that first point. So the idea there is you'll probably be more successful building and using an agent that is able to do its own sub-agent splitting of work versus a bunch of, say, Codex agents.

If you think of where is AI failing to create value today, it's mainly about not understanding the context. And the reason that it's not understanding the context is it's not plugged into the right places where actual work is happening. And as you do more of this, you can give the agent more of context and then it start to see the world around you and understand what are the set of metrics that you're optimizing for or what are the kind of activities that you're trying to do. It is a very easy extension from there to actually gain more out of it and then let the agent prompt you back. We already do this in terms of ChatGPT pulse, which kind of gives you this daily update of things you might care about.\n\nKiriti Badam: And it's very nice to actually have that jog your brain up in terms of, \"Oh, this is something that I haven't thought about. Maybe this is good.\" And now when you extend this to more complex tasks, like a coding agent, which says that, \"Okay, I have fixed five of your linear tickets and here are the patches. Just to review them at the start of your day.\" So I feel that is going to be extremely useful. And I see that as a strong direction in which products are going to build in 2026.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: That's so cool. So essentially agents anticipating what you want to do and getting ahead of you and I've solved these problems for you or I think this is going to crash your site. Maybe you should fix this thing right here or I see the spike here and let's refactor our database. Amazing. What a world. Okay. Ash, what do you got?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I'm all in for multimodal experiences in 2026. I think we have done quite some progress in 2025, and not just in terms of generation, but also understanding. Until now, I think LLMs have been our most commonly used modules, but as humans, we are multimodal creatures, I would say. Language is probably one of our last forms of evolution. As the three of us are talking, I think we're constantly getting so many signals. I'm like, \"Oh, Lenny's nodding his head, so probably I would go in this direction or Lenny's bored, so let me stop talking.\" So there's a chain of thought behind your chain of thought and you're constantly altering it with language that dimension of expression is not explored as well. So if we could build better multimodal experiences that would get us closer to human-like conversation richness. And you will also, just given the kind of models, there's a bunch of boring tasks as well, which are ripe for AI.",

And if it's possible, there'll be so much data that we can tap into.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: Awesome. I just saw Demis from DeepMind, AI, Google, whatever they call the whole org, talking about this where he thinks that's going to be a big part of where they're going, combining the image model work, the LLM, and also their world model stuff, Genie, I think is what it's called. Yes. So that's going to be a wild, wild time. Okay. Last question. If someone wants to just get better at building AI products, what's just maybe one skill or maybe two skills that you think they should lean into and develop?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think we did cover a bunch of best practices for AI products, which is start small, try to get your iteration going well and build a flywheel and all of that. But again, if you kind of look at it at a 10,000 feet level for anybody building today, like I was saying, implementation is going to be ridiculously cheap in the next few years. So really nail down your design, your judgment, your taste and all of that. And in general, if you're building a career as well, I feel for the past few years, your former years, say the first two, three years of building your career is always focused on execution, mechanics and all of that. And now we have AI that could help you ramp pretty quickly and post that. I mean, after a few years, I think everybody's job becomes about your taste, your judgment and kind of what is uniquely you.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think nail down on that part and try to figure out how you can bring in that kind of a perspective. It doesn't have to mean that you should be significantly old, have years of experience. We recently hired someone and we use this very popular app for tracking our tasks and we've been using it for years and we pay a high subscription fee for it. And this guy just came with his own vibe coded app to the meeting. He onboarded us to all of it and he's like, \"Okay, let's start using this.\" And I think that kind of agency and that kind of ownership to really rethink experiences is what will set people apart. And I'm not being blind to the fact that vibe coded apps have high maintenance costs. And maybe as we scale as a company, we have to replace it or we have to think of better approaches.",

If you've been used to working in a certain way, you associate a cost with building. And I feel like folks who grew up in this age have a much lower cost associated in their mind. They just don't mind building something and going ahead with it. And they're also very enthusiastic to try out new tools. That's also probably why AI products have this retention problem because everybody's so excited about trying out these new tools and all of that. But essentially having the agency and ownership, and I think it's also the going to be the end of the busy work era. You can't be sitting in a corner doing something that doesn't move the needle for a company. You really need to be thinking about end-to-end workflows, how you can bring in more impact.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think all of that will be super important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: That reminds me, I just had Jason Lemkit on the podcast. He's very smart on sales, go to market, run Saster, and he replaced his whole sales team with agents. He had 10 salespeople and then he was 1.2 and 20 agents. And one of the agents, it was just tracking everyone's updates to Salesforce and kind of updating it automatically for them based on their calls. And one of the salespeople was like, \"Okay, I quit.\" And it turned out he wasn't really doing anything. He was just sitting around and he's like, \"Okay, this will catch me. I got to get out of here. So to your point about, it'll be harder to sit around and twiddle your thumbs, I think is really right.\n\nKiriti Badam: Yeah. I think to add on to that, I feel like persistence is also something that is extremely valuable, especially given that anybody who wants to build something, the information is at your fingertips even more than the past decade. You can learn anything overnight and become that sort of Ironman kind of approach. So I feel like having that persistence and going through the pain of learning this, implementing this and understanding what works and what doesn't work. And as you are going through this pain of developing multiple approaches and then solving the problem, I feel that is going to be the real moat as an individual.

We covered so many of the pitfalls and the ways to actually do it correctly. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Be obsessed with your customers. Be obsessed with the problem. AI is just a tool and try to make sure that you're really understanding your workflows. 80% of so called AI engineers, AIPMs spend their time actually understanding their workflows very well. They're not building the fanciest and the most cool models or workflows around it. They're actually in the weeds understanding their customer's behavior and data. And whenever a software engineer who's never done AI before, here's the term, look at your data. I think it's a huge revelation to them, but it's always been the case. You need to go there, look at your data, understand your users, and that's going to be a huge differentiator.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: That's a great way to close it. The AI isn't the answer. It's a tool to solve the problem. With that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for both of you. Are you ready?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Yay. Yes.",

What are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: For me, it's this book called When Breath Becomes Air, Lenny. It was written by Paul Kalanithi. I think he was an Indian original neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with lung cancer at 31 or 32. And the whole book is his memoir and just is written after he was diagnosed. And it's really beautiful, especially because I read it during COVID and all we ever wanted to do during COVID is stay alive. There are a bunch of really nice quotes within the book as well, but I remember one of them, he was kind of arguing against a very popular quote by Socrates, which is, \"The unexamined life is not worth living,\" or something like that, which means you really need to be thinking about your choices, you need to understand your values, your mission and all of that. And Paul says, \"If the unexamined life is not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?\" Which means are you spending so much time just understanding your mission and purpose that you've forgotten to live?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: And I think everybody who's staying in the AI era and building and continuously going through the space of reinventing themselves need to take a pause and live for a bit, I guess. They need to stop evaling life too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: I was going to say that. That's where my mind went. You got to write some evals for your life. Oh my God, we've gone too far.",

You guys need to use it, build that yourself, an OpenAI version of that, or the Codex agent should just keep your Mac from sleeping. That's so funny. By the way, Raycast, also part of Lenny's product pass. One year for your Raycast. Amazing. Yeah.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: Lenny didn't tell us these folks. Yes. These are actually our favorite products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky: These are just two of 19 products. No Caffeinate though. I don't know if that's even paid. Okay, let's keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to in work or in life?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: For me, I think this is one my dad told me when I was a kid and it's always stuck, which is they told it couldn't be done, but the fool didn't know it, so he did it anyway. I think be foolish enough to believe that you can do anything if you put your heart to it, especially now because you have so much data at your hand that could be pointing towards the fact that you probably will be unsuccessful.

Whenever I have two guests on the podcast at once, I like to ask this question. What's something that you admire about the other person?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I think with Kiriti, he's pretty calm and very grounded and he's always been my sounding board. I can throw a ton of ideas at him and he always comes up with, he's able to anticipate the kind of issues that might land into. And he's extremely kind and lets his work speak instead of actually doing a lot of talking, I guess. But if I had to pick one, I think he's the most incredible husband.",

And that combined with persistence is super useful, especially in this fast-moving AI world that we are in the sense that there's so many new things coming up. It feels overwhelming, but when I hear her talk about, this is how you make sense of this entire thing, this is where it plugs in. I feel like, oh, that is so simple. I can also do that.

Final questions. Where can folks find stuff that you're working on, find you online, share your course link, and then just how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti: I write a lot on LinkedIn. So if you want to listen to pragmatists who've been in the weeds, working on AI products and what they're seeing, you can follow my work. We also have a GitHub repository with about 20K stars, and that repository is all about good resources for learning AI. It's completely free. And if you like what we spoke today, we also run a super popular course. We leave a link to it on building enterprise AI products. And the course is a lot about unlearning mindsets and following a problem-first approach instead of a tool-first or a hype-first approach. So you can check that out as well. And if you don't want to do the course, we write a lot, we give out a lot of free resources, we have free sessions, so make sure you follow our work.\n\nKiriti Badam: Yeah, I would also add that you can also find me on LinkedIn. I don't write a lot, I guess, but I'm super all excited to just talk to any complex product that you're building. And if you have thoughts on how you can use coding agents to make your life better or however the problems that you're seeing, always my DMs are open and we can have a great discussion.",
